<h2>
FOREWORD
</h2>

<p>
The author of this series of stories for children
has endeavored simply to show why and how the
descendants of the early colonists fought their way
through the wilderness in search of new homes. The
several narratives deal with the struggles of those
adventurous people who forced their way westward,
ever westward, whether in hope of gain or in answer
to "the call of the wild," and who, in so doing,
wrote their names with their blood across this
country of ours from the Ohio to the Columbia.
</p>

<p>
To excite in the hearts of the young people of
this land a desire to know more regarding the building
up of this great nation, and at the same time
to entertain in such a manner as may stimulate to
noble deeds, is the real aim of these stories. In them
there is nothing of romance, but only a careful,
truthful record of the part played by children in
the great battles with those forces, human as well
as natural, which, for so long a time, held a vast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
portion of this broad land against the advance of
home seekers.
</p>

<p>
With the knowledge of what has been done by
our own people in our own land, surely there is
no reason why one should resort to fiction in order
to depict scenes of heroism, daring, and sublime
disregard of suffering in nearly every form.

In case one should ask in the years to come
how it happened that I, Martha Early,
who was born in Ashley, Pike County,
in the state of Missouri, and lived there
until I was twelve years old, journeyed
across the prairies and deserts to California,
the question can be answered if
I write down what I saw when so many
people from our county went to make new
homes in that state where gold had been
found in such abundance.
</p>

<p>
For my part, I used to wonder why people should be
willing to leave Missouri, enduring the many hardships
they knew awaited them on the journey of two thousand
miles, in order to buy land in a country where nearly
all the inhabitants were Spaniards and Mexicans.
</p>

<p>
I suppose the stories told about the wonderful quantity
of gold which had suddenly been found in California
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
caused our people to think particularly of that far-off
land. When the excitement of getting rich by digging
in the earth a few weeks or a few months had in a
measure died away, there came tales regarding the
fertile soil and the beauty of the country, until nearly
every one in Pike County, as well as in the county of the
same name just across the Mississippi River in the state
of Illinois, much the same as had a fever for moving.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps that is why the people we met while
journeying called all the emigrants "Pikers." You
see there were so many from both the Pike counties
who went into California in the year 1851, that it
appeared to strangers as if every person on the trail
had come from Pike County.
</p>

<h2>
"JOE BOWERS"
</h2>

<p>
Then, too, fully half of all these emigrants were
singing or whistling that song of "Joe Bowers," which
was supposed to have been written by a Piker, and to
represent a man from Missouri or Illinois.
</p>

<p>
Surely every one remembers it. The first verse, and
if I have heard it once I certainly have a thousand times,
goes like this:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">
"My name it is Joe Bowers
</p>
<p class="i1">
  And I've got a brother Ike.
</p>
<p>
I came from old Missouri,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Yes, all the way from Pike."
</p>
</div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11'>[11]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The song was intended to show that this Joe Bowers
came from our county, and, perhaps, because so many
of the emigrants were singing it, all of us who went into
California in the year 1851 were, as I have said, called
"Pikers."
</p>

<p>
However the name came about, I was a Piker, and
before we arrived in this wondrously beautiful country,
I wished again and again that I had
been almost any other than an emigrant,
for the way was long, and oh!
so wearisome.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-012.jpg" width="496" height="379" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
I must always think of Missouri as being one of the
best of all the states in the Union, because it was there
I was born and there I went to school until father
caught the California fever, which resulted in our setting
out on a journey which, for a time, seemed endless.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12'>[12]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
My father had no idea of going so far simply to dig for
gold. He had seen many who went across the country
in 1849 believing they would come back rich as kings,
yet who returned home poorer in pocket than when
they left; therefore he came to understand that only
a few of all that vast army of miners who hastened
into California after the discovery at Sutter's Mill,
got enough of the precious metal to pay for the food
they ate.
</p>

<p>
Father thought he could buy better land in California
than was to be found in Pike County, for to have
heard the stories told by some of the people who had
come back disappointed from the land of gold, you
might have believed that one had only to put a few
seeds at random in the ground in order to gather
marvelous crops.
</p>

<h2>
THE REASONS FOR MOVING
</h2>

<p>
Nor was my father the only man who put faith in
at least some of the fanciful tales told concerning the
land of California which had so lately been given up
to the United States by the Spaniards. Our neighbors
for miles around were in a state of unrest and excitement,
until it was decided that nearly all would undertake
the long journey, and I could not prevent myself
from wondering if Pike County would not feel lonely
to have the people abandon it, for it surely seemed as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>
if every man, woman, and child was making haste to
leave Missouri in search of the wondrous farming
lands.
</p>

<p>
Mother looked woefully solemn when, on a certain evening,
father came home and told us that he had sold the
plantation for about half as much as it had
cost him, and was going to join the next
company that
set out from
Pike County.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-014.jpg" width="492" height="359" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
It was a long time before mother would have very
much to say about the journey, but as the days passed
and the neighbors who were going with us came to
our home that they might talk over the preparations
for moving, she became interested in making plans,
although again and again, when we two were alone, she
told me that this trailing over two thousand miles of
deserts and mountains was not to her liking.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14'>[14]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
MOTHER'S ANXIETY
</h2>

<p>
It was only natural she should be worried about
making such a great change, for all father's worldly
goods consisted of the Pike County plantation and
the live stock, and if, after selling the land and spending
very nearly all his money to provide for the journey,
we found that California farms were no better than
the one we were leaving, it would
be the saddest kind of mistake.
</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src="images/i-015.jpg" width="492" height="252" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
"Your father
has set his mind
on going; the
homestead has
been sold, and we must make
the best of it, Martha, hoping that half the stories
we have heard about California are true," she said to
me so many times that I came almost to believe it
was a foolish venture upon which we were about to
embark.
</p>

<p>
Then, when I began to wonder how we were to live
during such a long journey, and asked mother if it would
be possible for us to cook and churn and do the family
washing while traveling in an ox wagon, she would say
with a sigh:&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Don't, Martha, don't ask questions that I can't
answer! It seems to me almost certain that we shall
starve to death before getting anywhere near California,
even if we are not killed by Indians or wild beasts,
without having had time to get very hungry or
dirty."
</p>

<p>
Yet we did travel the two thousand miles, walking
the greater part of the way, and although there were
many times when all of us were hungry, none actually
starved to death; nor were we killed by wild beasts or
Indians, else I could not be here in this beautiful place
writing this story.
</p>

<p>
Father spent days and days getting ready for the
moving. After he had finished the preparations, I
thought the journey would not be so terribly hard, because
he had arranged everything so snug and cozy for
mother and me, that it really seemed as if we might
take actual comfort in case we could make shift to do
housework in a wagon.
</p>

<h2>
HOW WE WERE TO TRAVEL
</h2>

<p>
We owned only four yoke of cattle, but with some of
the money received from the sale of the plantation,
we bought as many more, which gave us sixteen oxen.
We were to take with us all five of the cows and both the
horses, on which father said mother and I might ride
when we were tired of sitting in the wagon; but I knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>[16]</a></span>
what kind of animals ours were under the saddle, and
said to myself that it would be many a long day before
I would trust myself on the back of either.
</p>

<p>
It would have done you good to see our movable
home after father had made it ready, and by that I
mean the wagon in which mother and I were to ride.
It was small compared with the other, in which were to
be carried enough furniture for a single room, farming
tools, grain for the cattle, and a host of things; but I
did not give much heed to the load because I was so
deeply interested in what was to be a home for mother
and me during many a month.
</p>

<p>
That wagon was enough to attract the attention of
any girl, for, fitted up as I first saw it, the inside looked
really like a playhouse, and when I said as much to
father, he declared that I was indeed the right kind of
girl to go into a wild country, if I could find anything
like sport during the tramp from Pike County to California.
</p>

<p>
I surely must tell you about that wagon before
setting down anything concerning the journey. It
was what is known as a Conestoga, and one may see
many of the same kind on the Santa Fe or the Oregon
trail. Imagine a boxlike cart nearly as long as an
ordinary bedroom and so wide that I could stretch
myself out at full length across the body. The top
and sides were covered with osnaburg sheeting, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17'>[17]</a></span>
is cloth made of flax or tow. Some people really sleep
between sheets made of that coarse stuff, but it is
so rough and irritating to the flesh that I had far rather
lie on the floor than in a bed where it is used.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-018.jpg" width="491" height="465" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Osnaburg sheeting makes excellent wagon covers,
however, for the rain cannot soak through the cloth,
and it is so cheap that one can well afford to use it in
double thickness, which serves to keep out the wind
as well as the water.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
OUR MOVABLE HOME
</h2>

<p>
The front of the wagon and a small window-like place
at the end were left open, but could be securely closed
with curtains that buttoned at the sides.
</p>

<p>
Around the inside of the wagon were hung such things
as we might need to use often during the journey.
There were pots and pans, towels, clothing, baskets,
and two rifles, for father believed weapons might be
required when we came upon disagreeable savages, or
if game was to be found within shooting distance.
</p>

<p>
Our cookstove was set up at the rear end of the wagon,
where it could be pushed out on a small shelf fastened
to the rear axle, when we wanted to use it. A most
ingenious contrivance we found that shelf to be, for
mother and I could remain inside the wagon and do our
cooking in stormy weather; but those women of the company
whose husbands had not been so thoughtful were
forced to stay out of doors while preparing a meal, no
matter how hard it might be raining.
</p>

<p>
Our beds were laid in the bottom of the wagon and
covered with the bedclothes to save them from being
badly soiled, as would be likely if we slept upon them
at night, and cooked, ate, and did the housework on
them during the daytime.
</p>

<p>
We did not try to carry many dishes, because there
were so many chances they would be broken, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19'>[19]</a></span>
nearly everything of the kind we used was of metal,
such as tin or iron.
</p>

<p>
Underneath the cart were hung buckets, the churn,
lanterns, and such a collection of articles that I could
not but fancy people might believe we were peddlers
carrying so large an assortment of goods that they
had overrun the wagon body.
</p>

<p>
What puzzled me before we started on the journey
was how we could persuade the cows to travel as we
would have them; but I soon came to understand that
it was a simple matter.
</p>

<h2>
LEAVING ASHLEY
</h2>

<p>
You must know that father was not the only man
in Ashley that intended to build up a new home in
California. More than half of the people were making
preparations for the journey, and when we finally set
off the procession was very imposing, with more than
fifty wagons, not one of them drawn by less than three
yoke of oxen or four pairs of mules; there were cows
almost without number and a flock of thirty or forty
sheep.
</p>

<p>
I said to myself then, that we need have no fear the
savages would try to make trouble for us, because when
they saw so many people, the poor, ignorant things
would believe everybody on the banks of the Mississippi
was heading for California, and it would be a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20'>[20]</a></span>
very brave Indian who dared be other than polite
to such a large company.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-021.jpg" width="504" height="456" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Even though you had never before heard of Pike
County, it would have been most interesting to see
the people of Ashley on the morning we set off. As
Ellen Morgan, a particular friend of mine who was
going to California also, said to me just before we
drove away, "It is much as if all the folks in the world
had come to see us leave town."
</p>

<p>
The streets were actually thronged, as I have heard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21'>[21]</a></span>
it said the streets of a large city oftentimes are, and
what with the shouts of the men, the screams of the children,
and the lowing of the cattle, it was quite as much
as I could do to make myself heard when I tried to
tell Ellen that at the last minute mother had given
permission for her to ride in our wagon.
</p>

<p>
Of course the noise in the street could not have
been as great as I fancied, for Ellen had no trouble
in hearing me, as was shown when she came running
back to our wagon with her Sunday frock and other
valuable things neatly done up in a corn sack.
</p>

<p>
Then it seemed to me that no improvement could
be made upon our manner of
traveling, for we two girls were
to be together all the while, and
even when the weather was stormy,
it would seem really cozy under our
double thickness of osnaburg cloth.
</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src="images/i-022.jpg" width="161" height="232" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
It surprised me very much because
mother acted as if it saddened
her to set off on what could
not fail to be a delightful journey. I saw tears in her
eyes when she came out of our old home for the last
time, and wondered if she was sorry because she was
leaving the house where we had lived so long, or
whether she believed we would never find another
such delightful town as Ashley.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>[22]</a></span>
</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src="images/i-023.jpg" width="312" height="260" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Of course I felt just a little tearful when those
people who were to remain at home gathered around
the wagon to say "good-by";
but there were so many of our
neighbors in the company we
would not have a
chance to be lonely,
and I was certain
that all the friends
we were leaving behind
would soon join us, having
come to realize, as had
father, that California was the only proper place in
which to live.
</p>

<h2>
EBEN JORDAN
</h2>

<p>
If I could have had everything arranged exactly to
please me, I would have insisted that Eben Jordan be
left in Ashley. He is a boy about six months older
than I, who always seems to take the greatest delight
in teasing us girls. I had no doubt but that he would
be very disagreeable at times, and felt, on that first
day, as if there could be no cloud on the California
skies if Eben had remained in Pike County.
</p>

<p>
It is no more than fair for me to say, however, that,
much as I disliked the boy, Eben Jordan was one
who ever kept his ears open to the conversation of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>[23]</a></span>
his elders and was more than willing to repeat to Ellen
and me whatever he learned.
</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src="images/i-024.jpg" width="309" height="314" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Even before our company had left Ashley, he told
us the journey was to be begun by first going to Independence,
a town on the
Missouri River where the
Santa Fe traders and
those who would journey
by the Oregon
trail made ready
for the long march.
</p>

<p>
Up to this time I had
had no idea of how we
were to get to California,
save we drove directly
across the prairies and
over the mountains, always in a westerly direction.
</p>

<p>
But I must have understood that we could not
strike off across the country in any direction we fancied,
because we must follow some trail in order to find a
plentiful supply of grass for the cattle and mules and
sheep, as well as water for ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Eben said that the leaders of the company, among
whom was my father, had talked not a little regarding
the country through which we should pass. Thus he
learned that we would journey over what is known as
the Oregon trail as far as Fort Bridger, after which, striking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>[24]</a></span>
off to the southward somewhat, we would go along
the shores of the Great Salt Lake, past Ogden's Hole, to
the land of the Bannock Indians. Then the course was
to be as nearly westward as the foothills would permit.
</p>

<p>
"It will be a rare time for us all," Eben said gleefully,
after having told us girls that we would journey
nearly two thousand miles before coming to that
land for which we sought. "There will be game
until a fellow can't rest, and after we are once well
on the way, we shall come upon Indian tribe after
Indian tribe, when you girls will be only too glad to
shelter yourselves under my wing, for there is no
knowing what the savages may take it into their
heads to do, providing the opportunity offers."
</p>

<p>
Ellen was not a little displeased because Eben
seemingly believed we would be glad of his protection,
and I really felt uneasy in mind when the lad left
us to go to his father's wagon, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It isn't well for you girls to be so high and mighty,
because before this journey has come to an end you
may be glad that I am willing to lend a hand."
</p>

<p>
Ellen laughed at the idea that the time would ever
come when we might accept a favor from Eben Jordan.
She seemed so certain nothing disagreeable could happen
to us while our company was so large, that I soon
put away all forebodings and gave strict attention to
what was before us.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25'>[25]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
ON THE ROAD
</h2>

<p>
It had taken our fathers considerable time to get
the people and the cattle in proper marching order;
but once this was done, they gave the word for the
procession to move forward, and the people at Ashley
whom we were leaving
behind cheered us
wildly as we went
slowly out from the town.
</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src="images/i-026.jpg" width="307" height="399" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
It seemed much like
taking part in some wondrous
celebration, to
be riding thus amid
those who were
cheering and, I dare
say, envying us.
</p>

<p>
Mother was content
to sit inside the wagon,
where father had placed a
short-legged chair for her
convenience, but Ellen and I remained on the front
seat where we could see all that was going on, and
until we were well clear of the town it did seem to
me that I was a very important person.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the forenoon before we started, therefore
no halt was to be made for dinner, but this gave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26'>[26]</a></span>
me little uneasiness, for mother had an ample supply of
cooked provisions on hand.
</p>

<p>
Our neighbors at Ashley had spoken again and again
of the hardships which we would encounter before
arriving at the shores of the Pacific Ocean, and I said
to Ellen, when we were two or three miles from the
town, that I could not understand how any one could
believe such a journey might be either wearisome or
dangerous.
</p>

<h2>
EBEN'S PREDICTIONS
</h2>

<p>
Surely we were as comfortable as two girls could be,
with a covering over our heads in case it rained, and
enough food to satisfy our desires.
</p>

<p>
Therefore what difference did it make, as I said to
Ellen, whether we were five months or six on the march?
Eben Jordan, who had come back from his father's
wagon along the line of procession as if to see that
everything was right, overhearing my words, replied
with a laugh, which sounded to me very disagreeable:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You may well say, Martha Early, that this portion
of the journey is easy. We are now traveling on a
beaten road, with nothing to prevent our going forward
at the best pace of the oxen. Wait until we have
really started, after having come to Independence, and
leave the highway to take to the trail. You will find
the wagon tumbling and pitching over the rocks, or
floundering across fords, where watch must be kept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27'>[27]</a></span>
sharply against the Indians, and every man needs to
have his eyes open lest he be attacked by wild beasts.
Then you shall say to me whether it makes no difference
to you if this journey requires five months or six."
</p>

<p>
I refused to listen to the lad, who seemed to find the
greatest pleasure in making other people uncomfortable
in mind, and I turned toward Ellen, as if speaking to
her very earnestly in whispers, thereby causing Eben
to believe I had not heard what he said, whereupon
he went off laughing.
</p>

<h2>
WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT CALIFORNIA
</h2>

<p>
We had heard people talking about the wonderful
fortunes to be found in California, until it seemed as if
we might become rich simply by digging in the ground
a bit; but, as you shall hear, before our journey had
come to an end we understood that however much
valuable metal there might be in the earth, it was not
to be gathered like pebbles.
</p>

<p>
We met on our way hundreds of people who had
gone into California with great expectations and were
coming back poorer than when they set out; but on
the first day we were ignorant of all this, and quite
convinced that it was a simple matter to become
wealthy by a very little labor.
</p>

<p>
Before night came there was to me less pleasure
than during the first hour or two. The wagon jolted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>[28]</a></span>
over the roads roughly, making it necessary to hold
firmly to the seat, lest I be thrown off, and it became
wearisome to sit so long in one position.
</p>

<p>
Mother, who stretched herself out upon a bed in
the bottom of the wagon when she was tired of sitting
upright, did not weary so soon of this kind of traveling;
but nevertheless she was quite as well pleased as Ellen
and I, when, about four o'clock in the afternoon, word
was given that we should halt and make camp.
</p>

<h2>
THE FIRST ENCAMPMENT
</h2>

<p>
We were yet in a fairly thickly settled portion of
the country; but the leaders of our company determined
to make the encampment exactly as if we were
on the prairie or among the mountains, where there
might be danger from wild beasts or wilder savages,
and you may well fancy that Ellen and I were on our
feet as soon as the wagon came to a stop, for we had
heard so much of this camp making that both of us
were eager to see how it was done.
</p>

<p>
All the wagons were drawn up in a large circle so that
the tongue of one came close to the tailboard of another,
and just inside this ring of vehicles were set up
small tents, which many of the company were to use
at night because their families were so large that
every one could not be given room in the wagons.
</p>

<p>
Inside this row of tents were picketed the horses,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29'>[29]</a></span>
or, at least, they were to be picketed as soon as night
should come; but when we first halted they were
fastened out upon the plain where they might eat the
grass, while the oxen, cows, and sheep were turned
loose with half a dozen of the men and boys watching
lest they should stray.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-030.jpg" width="500" height="177" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Because the people were not accustomed to thus
making an encampment, no little time was spent in
getting everything into what the leaders of the company
believed to be proper order, and then our mothers
set about cooking supper.
</p>

<p>
In our wagon the stove was pushed back upon the
shelf made expressly for it, short lengths of pipe were
run through the osnaburg cloth and tied by wire to
the topmost part of the rear wagon bow, so they might
be held straight, and then mother set about her work
much as if she had been at home.
</p>

<p>
It was most pleasant camping in the open air, and
before we had been halted an hour the place was
quite homelike.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30'>[30]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At nearly every wagon one or more women were
making ready for supper; a short distance away the
men and the boys were herding the cattle, and near by,
inside or out of the inclosure, were scores and scores
of idle ones, who, their work being done, were now
enjoying a time of rest.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-031.jpg" width="499" height="481" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
There was much talking and shouting, but
above all one could hear that song of the true
Pikers:&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31'>[31]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">
"My name it is Joe Bowers,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  And I've got a brother Ike.
</p>
<p>
I came from old Missouri,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Yes, all the way from Pike."
</p>
</div></div>

<h2>
NIGHT IN CAMP
</h2>

<p>
How Ellen and I enjoyed the supper on this first
night of the journey! Mother made sour-milk biscuit;
the stove worked to perfection, as if delighted because
it was being carried to California; and what with
cold meat and steaming hot tea it seemed as if I had
never tasted anything better than that meal.
</p>

<p>
Although we had enjoyed ourselves hugely, especially
during the first part of the day's march, both Ellen and
I were tired, and when mother said we might make up
our bed on the bottom of the wagon, we were not only
willing, but eager to do so, for after the hearty supper
it seemed as if sleep had become a necessity.
</p>

<p>
Once we had crossed over into Dreamland, our eyes
were not opened again until the sun was near to rising;
then the shouts of the men and the lowing of the
cattle caused us to spring up suddenly, almost fancying
that the camp had been attacked by savages, even
though we were not yet out of Pike County.
</p>

<p>
If I had the time, it would please me to describe
the journey from our home in Ashley to a town known
as Independence, on the Missouri River, where the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32'>[32]</a></span>
Oregon trail begins; but since, as father said again
and again, we did not really start until we had struck
the Oregon trail, it is best that I leave out all that
happened while we were coming from Pike County to
the Missouri River.
</p>

<h2>
THE TOWN OF INDEPENDENCE
</h2>

<p>
We traveled slowly, because the cows were not
easily herded, and, as Eben Jordan said, none of our
people were accustomed to such kind of marching.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
 <img src="images/i-033.jpg" width="464" height="221" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
We did, however, finally arrive at the real starting
point after eight days, during which time Ellen and I
came to understand that, however pleasant it was to
sit in the wagon and look out upon the country through
which we passed, it might grow wearisome.
</p>

<p>
Ellen and I had fancied we would see something
very new and wonderful at Independence, and yet,
while everything was strange and there was much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33'>[33]</a></span>
to attract one's attention, it was not so very different
from other settlements through which we had
passed.
</p>

<p>
There was, however, a constant bustle and confusion
such as one could not see elsewhere. Enormous
wagons, which Eben Jordan said belonged to the
traders who went over the Santa Fe trail, were coming
into town or going out, each drawn by eight or ten
mules and accompanied by Spaniards or Negroes,
until one could but wonder where so many people
were going.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-034.jpg" width="500" height="318" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
There were trains, much like our own, belonging
to settlers who were going into Oregon, or, like ourselves,
into California. Those were halted just outside
the town, until the entire settlement was literally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34'>[34]</a></span>
surrounded, while among them all, near the wagons
of the traders as well as those of the emigrants, lounged
Indians, nothing like the people I had imagined the
savages to be.
</p>

<h2>
KANSAS INDIANS
</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-035.jpg" width="382" height="431" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
As Ellen said, if that was the kind of Indian we
should meet with during the journey, then we need have
little or no fear, for the savages we saw at Independence
were nothing more nor less than beggars, who would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35'>[35]</a></span>
greedily pick up and devour anything eatable that was
thrown at them. Eben Jordan made himself ridiculous
by marching around armed
with a rifle, and a huge
knife thrust in his belt, as
if expecting each instant
to be called upon
to defend his life.
</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src="images/i-036.jpg" width="328" height="253" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
We were tired of
the settlement, even before
we had fairly arrived, and after
Ellen and I walked through the town,
wondering not a little at seeing a number of the
houses and stores built entirely of brick, we were content
to return to our own encampment, which was
about half a mile out on the prairie.
</p>

<h2>
LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE FOR TROUBLE
</h2>

<p>
Up to this time mother and I had but little trouble
in preparing the meals whenever we came to a halt;
but I heard some of the men say that within a few days
after we were once on the trail, all this would be changed.
There would be many times when we might not
find sufficient fuel to keep a fire in the stove, when we
would feel the pangs of thirst because of not being
able to get enough water, and when, the stock of
provisions which we had brought with us having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36'>[36]</a></span>
been consumed, we would know what it was to be
hungry.
</p>

<p>
When I repeated to mother what I had heard, she
nodded her head sadly, replying that she had thought
of all these things when father first determined to seek
a new home in the California country, and she doubted
not that we would come to know much suffering, before
we arrived at our journey's end.
</p>

<p>
As may be supposed, I was not in a cheerful mood
when Ellen and I went to bed that night. During
the half hour or more while we lay there wakeful, we
spoke of all the possibilities of the future, and almost
regretted that our parents had decided to leave Pike
County, for surely they could find nowhere on the face
of this earth a place more agreeable in which to live.
</p>

<h2>
A STORMY DAY
</h2>

<p>
When another morning came, it surely seemed as if
all my fears were about to be realized, for the day
dawned dark and forbidding, the rain came down in
torrents, while the wind sighed and moaned as it drove
floods of water from one end of the wagon to the
other, wetting us completely even before we were
awake.
</p>

<p>
I could not believe father would set off on the journey
at such a time as this, and was wondering how we
should be able to cook breakfast, when he called to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37'>[37]</a></span>
mother that she make ready the morning meal, for in
half an hour the train would be in motion.
</p>

<p>
No one had been sufficiently thoughtful to store
beneath the wagon a supply of dry fuel, and the consequence
was that we had nothing with which to build
a fire, save a few armfuls of water-soaked wood which
father and Eben Jordan succeeded in gathering, for
where so many emigrants were encamped, fuel of any
kind was indeed scarce.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-038.jpg" width="500" height="390" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
I almost forgave Eben for having appeared so ridiculous
when he strutted around fully armed, as I saw him
striving to gather wood for us when he might have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38'>[38]</a></span>
remained under the cover of his father's wagon; indeed,
before many days passed both Ellen and I saw that
there was much good in the boy's heart, even though
he was too often disposed to make matters disagreeable
for us girls.
</p>

<h2>
A LACK OF FUEL
</h2>

<p>
Mother and I made our first attempt at cooking
while the stove was beneath the wagon cover and the
pipe thrust out through the hole in the rear.
</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src="images/i-039.jpg" width="311" height="491" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
If we had had
plenty of dry wood,
I have no doubt
but that the work
could have been
done with some
degree of comfort;
but as it was, we
were put to our
wits' ends, even to
get sufficient heat
to boil the water,
and when word was given for the
company to start, we had not really
begun to cook the breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Of course it would have been
dangerous for us to attempt to
keep a fire burning while the wagon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39'>[39]</a></span>
was moving. Therefore we would have been forced
to set off without breakfast, had not Ellen's mother
kindly sent us some corn bread which she had baked
the night before, and this, with fresh milk, made up our
meal.
</p>

<p>
At the time I thought I was much injured because
of not having more food; but before we had come to
the land of California I often looked back upon that
morning with longing, remembering the meal of corn
bread and milk as though it was a feast.
</p>

<p>
During all the long day, except for half an hour at
noon, the patient oxen plodded wearily on amid the
rain, oftentimes sinking fetlock-deep in the marshy
places. Everything was damp and every place uncomfortable,
and at times it seemed as if I could no longer
bear up under the suffering.
</p>

<p>
In order to teach me that, instead of grumbling, I
ought to be thankful for the comforts I could enjoy,
mother told me to look at those who were exposed to
the storm. I saw father and the other men walking
beside the oxen, the rain pelting down upon them
pitilessly; I heard the cry of a baby in pain; and I
soon came to understand that my lot was far less
hard than that of many others.
</p>

<p>
She read me a lesson on patience and contentment,
whatever might be my surroundings, until I grew
ashamed of having shown myself so disagreeable.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40'>[40]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
MAKING CAMP IN A STORM
</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-041.jpg" width="308" height="349" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Determined as I was to make the best of whatever
might happen, I could not but be disheartened when,
nearly at nightfall, we halted to make camp again.
The rain was still descending like a cloud-burst; everything
around us, including the bedding, seemed saturated
with water.
Yet I saw the
men spread the thin
cloth tents, after
the wagons had
been drawn up in
a circle, or made
into a corral as the
travelers on the
trail call it; I saw
them wade ankle-deep
in the mud,
but with never
an impatient word
or gesture. It appeared sufficient to them if their
women and children could enjoy some little degree of
comfort.
</p>

<p>
Again we strove to do our cooking under the wagon
covers, and again we were in need of fuel. Ellen and
I, with the skirts of our gowns over our heads for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41'>[41]</a></span>
protection, scurried here and there, picking up twigs
and crying out with delight when we came upon a
piece of wood as large as one's fist.
</p>

<p>
You can well imagine what kind of supper we had
that night. The inside of the wagon was filled with
smoke, for the short length of stovepipe did not afford
a strong draft, and mother labored, with the tears
streaming down her cheeks, to fry as much bacon as
would satisfy our hunger.
</p>

<p>
The smoke was so dense that we all wept, smiling
even in the midst of our seeming tears when father said,
after he had milked the cows and had brought in quite
as much water as milk, that it was a question with him
whether he could stand better the smoke or the rain.
He was inclined to think he had rather be soaked
with water than cured like a ham.
</p>

<p>
Again Eben Jordan showed his kindness of heart,
for he insisted upon helping this man and that, milk
the cows and herd the oxen and sheep, and he did
whatever came to his hand, all the while humming
"Joe Bowers."
</p>

<p>
When Eben came into our wagon later in the evening,
Ellen and I treated him very kindly, for we were
coming to understand that this boy, who found so
much pleasure in vexing us girls, was ever ready to do a
good turn to another, even when it cost him much
labor and discomfort.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42'>[42]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
A THUNDERSTORM
</h2>

<p>
During all that night it rained; but shortly after
midnight there came up such a terrific storm of thunder
and lightning that it seemed as if the very heavens
were bursting.
</p>

<p>
Then all our men and boys were forced to go and
quiet the cattle, for the beasts were even as frightened
as we girls were, and, so father said, would have stampeded,
leaving us to spend the next day searching for
them on the prairies, had it not been for the precautions
of our people.
</p>

<p>
When I complained to mother, just after father had
gone out into the tempest, that this journey to California
was nothing like what I had pictured it, she
said mildly that if I was growing disheartened now, it
would have been better had I never set out from
Pike County, for thus far matters had gone much to
our convenience and that shortly we would find real
trials and real troubles.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, however, my spirits rose, for the sun
was shining brightly when I awoke; but word was
passed around the camp that instead of setting off at
once, we might spend two hours drying the bed clothing
and such of our belongings as had been saturated
during the storm.
</p>

<p>
Then there was presented such a scene as would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43'>[43]</a></span>
have interested any one who had never witnessed the
like before. On every wagon tongue were hung
blankets and garments of all kinds, and over the
wheels of each cart lay feather beds or bolsters, until
it must have looked as if every member of our company
had spent a day in washing, and was now about to do
the ironing.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-044.jpg" width="492" height="161" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Eben Jordan went here and there, aiding this one
or that when he had done what he might for his mother,
all the while singing "My name it is Joe Bowers,"
until, even before our breakfast had been cooked,
fully half the company were joining in that foolish
song. Mother said almost fretfully, when Ellen and
I took up the refrain, that she wished the senseless
words had never been written, or that we had never
heard them.
</p>

<h2>
ANOTHER COMPANY OF PIKERS
</h2>

<p>
Although we started off late that morning, owing
to the drying out, we halted early in the afternoon,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44'>[44]</a></span>
for we had come upon a company of men and women
who, like ourselves, were bound for the land of California.
The leader of the company was Colonel
Russell.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-045.jpg" width="498" height="444" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
To my surprise and delight these people also proved
to be Pikers, having come from a settlement about
twenty miles south of our old home. You may readily
fancy how enjoyable was that evening, when we visited
from wagon to wagon, listening to the stories of
what had thus far happened to the company, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45'>[45]</a></span>
repeating our own adventures, if such they could be
called.
</p>

<p>
While we women and girls were thus engaged, the
men of both companies decided to travel together, believing
that by increasing the number there might be
less danger from the Indians, for Eben Jordan said
that the savages we saw at Independence were but
imitations of the fiercer ones whom we were most likely
to meet before our journey's end.
</p>

<h2>
THE STOCK STRAY AWAY
</h2>

<p>
I suppose it was the excitement occasioned by the
meeting with Colonel Russell's company, which caused
our men in charge of the cattle to be careless during the
evening and later in the night, for when morning came
we found that nearly all the oxen and a goodly number
of the cows had strayed from the camp and disappeared
completely.
</p>

<p>
When Eben Jordan first told us of this, I believed a
great disaster had come upon us; but straightway
father and half a dozen of the other men mounted the
horses and set off across the prairie in search of the
missing cattle, as if this was trouble to be expected.
</p>

<p>
In fact, before many days passed, I came to look upon
the straying or the stampeding of the live stock as of
little consequence.
</p>

<p>
We had plenty of time to cook breakfast that morning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46'>[46]</a></span>
while the men were searching over the prairie for
the cattle, and, much to my surprise, within three hours
all the stock had been brought into the encampment and
we were making ready once more for the day's journey.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-047.jpg" width="494" height="286" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Before noon we arrived at Blue Creek, where we had,
as it seemed to me, much trouble because the trail
leading to the stream was deep with mud, and the
bottom of the creek so soft that our people were forced
to wade waist-deep on either side of the wagons, lest
the wheels sink so far down that the oxen would not be
able to pull the heavy loads across.
</p>

<p>
Again and again the men laid hold of the wheels,
straining every muscle as the drivers of the cattle
urged the patient beasts to their utmost exertions, and
before all our company had crossed that small creek the
day was so nearly at an end that there was nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47'>[47]</a></span>
left for us to do save camp once more, although we
had traveled only six miles since setting out.
</p>

<p>
Then came Sunday morning, when I believed we
would remain idle, for it did not seem right that we
should travel on the Lord's day; but, as father said,
while we were making such a long journey it was
necessary to push ahead during every hour of fair
weather, and to take our day of rest only when it was
absolutely necessary.
</p>

<p>
And so, instead of worshiping God as we would have
done had we remained in Pike County, we went forward,
fording two small creeks and journeying over a dull,
level plain, whereon, save flowers, nothing was to be
seen to delight the eye.
</p>

<h2>
AN INDIAN VILLAGE
</h2>

<p>
Within an hour of sunset we came to a veritable
Indian village, although there were not many of the
savages living in it, and Ellen and I took advantage
of this first opportunity to see the redskins in their
homes.
</p>

<p>
There were but four men, with perhaps a dozen
women and children, all living in lodges made of smoke-dried
skins, and looking exceedingly dirty and disagreeable.
</p>

<p>
We girls were not inclined to linger there long,
although the Indians were willing we should, and when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48'>[48]</a></span>
our short visit had been brought to a close, they followed
us, clustering around our wagons and waiting
patiently for food to be thrown to them.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-049.jpg" width="492" height="376" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
From this time on during a full week we continued
to push steadily forward, moving so slowly that even
we girls could understand the journey would be exceedingly
long and wearisome.
</p>

<h2>
I WEARY WITH SO MUCH TRAVELING
</h2>

<p>
More than once did I reproach myself with having
been so eager to leave Pike County, and many times
I said to myself that a girl who has a happy home
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49'>[49]</a></span>
is indeed foolish to wish for a change, lest, like
Ellen and me, they find, as mother often says,
that they have jumped out of the frying pan into
the fire.
</p>

<p>
One day was much like another. Now the trail
would be hard underfoot and the traveling easy,
and again we would cross
a stream, the bottom
lands of which
were so marshy
that the oxen
lugged and
strained at
their yokes,
until oftentimes
it was
necessary
to double
up the
teams in
order that the
heavy wagons could be pulled over the soft footing.
</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src="images/i-050.jpg" width="412" height="399" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
The only thing I remember which came to break
the monotony of the slow march was when, on a certain
evening, father returned with his pockets and
hands full of wild onions which he had found on the
prairie. Because our meals had consisted chiefly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50'>[50]</a></span>
of corn bread and salted meat, I said to myself that
now we would have a feast.
</p>

<p>
But alas! those wild onions were like my dreams
about traveling to the land of California. While
they looked fair on the outside before being cooked,
they were so strong to the taste that one nearly choked
in trying to eat them.
</p>

<h2>
EBEN'S BOASTS
</h2>

<p>
Eben Jordan, hearing of my disappointment, said
with a laugh that when we came to the country where
game was to be found he intended to bring into camp
all the fresh meat the company could eat, and one
might have thought from the way the boy talked that
he believed himself capable of feeding all our company
unaided.
</p>

<p>
It would have been well if Eben had contented himself
with predicting the marvels which he counted on
performing; but, instead, he reminded me that before
we had come into the Land of Promise I might be
more than willing to eat wild onions and "smack my
lips over the disagreeable food."
</p>

<p>
It seems that he heard, while in Independence, of
the sufferings of some people who had journeyed over
that same trail, when they found no game and their
provisions were consumed before the march came to
an end.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51'>[51]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It would have been better, so I said to him, if he had
not repeated such things, for surely we were getting
all the discomfort that was needed to show how foolish
we had been in leaving Pike County, where no one
suffered from hunger or thirst, if he had a tongue in
his head to make known his desires.
</p>

<p>
It seemed almost as if the boy was a real prophet,
for within a few hours Ellen and I did come to know
what thirst&mdash;bitter, parching thirst&mdash;was like.
</p>

<p>
We had started out one morning when the rays of
the sun beat down upon us so fervently that the wagon
covering seemed to be no protection, and the only
relief we had was from the gentle breeze which was
blowing, not with sufficient force to relieve our suffering,
but enough to prevent us from being literally baked.
</p>

<h2>
SUFFERING WITH THIRST
</h2>

<p>
We drank, as did all our company, of the water which
we carried in kegs stowed in the wagons, and gave no
heed to the fact that the supply was scanty, for until
this time there had never been any lack of water.
</p>

<p>
At noon even the breeze died away; there was not a
cloud in the sky, the trail was smooth and hard, running
over what father called the tableland of the prairie,
and the heat so intense that there were times when it
surely seemed as if I could not longer continue to
breathe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52'>[52]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then, when our sufferings were seemingly as great
as they could possibly be, mother discovered that our
store of water had been exhausted, and called to father,
asking that he get a supply from one of the other wagons.
</p>

<p>
It seemed strange to me then, and does even now,
that at almost the same time all our company had run
short of water, and from one
end of the long train to the
other we could not beg
enough to moisten our
tongues.
</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src="images/i-053.jpg" width="311" height="317" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Perhaps it was the
knowledge that I
could not quench
my thirst which
caused me to suffer
more severely, and
when father said
we must travel no less than twelve miles before coming
to any stream, my heart sank within me.
</p>

<p>
Ellen was suffering quite as much as I, except that
she had the good sense to hold her peace, and mother,
patient with me as ever, said all she could to prevent
me from dwelling too much upon my condition.
</p>

<p>
Nor was I the only one in that company to suffer
severely. Whenever the train came to a halt that the
cattle might have a breathing spell, I could hear the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53'>[53]</a></span>
smaller children crying for something to drink, and once
during the afternoon Eben Jordan came alongside our
wagon, asking if our water kegs were empty.
</p>

<p>
Then I saw upon his face that look of eagerness and
desire such as I had read on Ellen's, and when I told him
we were suffering from thirst even more than any other
members of the company, he shook his head and replied:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is the younger ones who suffer the most, Martha
Early, for they cannot be made to understand that it is
necessary to wait; while you and I, who are older,
know it is only a case of grinning and bearing it as best
we may."
</p>

<h2>
IN SEARCH OF WATER
</h2>

<p>
I was irritated because Eben should read me a
lesson, for indeed his words sounded like a reproof. I
turned away from him, saying to myself that if it was
not possible to make the oxen move more rapidly,
there was danger of my dying, all of which was foolishness,
even wickedness, as you will agree.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-054.jpg" width="492" height="200" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'>[54]</a></span></p>

<p>
To force the beasts to a more rapid pace was absolutely
impossible. Already the sheep as well as the oxen
were showing signs of exhaustion and panting for water.
Their tongues were hanging out, and they moved slowly
as if unable to go farther, while five of the cows had
dropped down on the trail as if dying.
</p>

<p>
We were forced to leave them behind, fearing lest
if time was spent in trying to get the
beasts on their feet again,
more of the stock would fall.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-055.jpg" width="498" height="297" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
I hardly knew how
the remainder of that
day passed, for I gave
no heed to anything
save my own suffering, thereby showing myself
wickedly selfish, until a great shout went up from
those who were in advance, telling that at last, after
what seemed like many, many long hours, we had
come within sight of a stream of water.
</p>

<p>
Then the oxen, wild with thirst and smelling the
dampness in the air, plunged forward as if in a fury,
for the drivers were unable to hold them in check.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55'>[55]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In a mad race went every yoke of the cattle, drawing
the heavy wagons that lurched first on one side and
then on the other as we went over the uneven surface of
the trail, until all the contents which had been stowed
so carefully were thrown violently about, while we
girls and mother had the greatest difficulty to save
ourselves from being flung out.
</p>

<h2>
QUENCHING OUR THIRST
</h2>

<p>
The oxen continued on until every yoke of them
stood in the creek, and there they halted, drinking
eagerly until their sides swelled out as if bursting.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of the fact that our wagon was standing
in not less than twelve inches of water, Ellen and I
leaped out and drank from the stream like dogs, too
thirsty to wait longer.
</p>

<p>
I have been in need of water many times since that
day, but never have I suffered so keenly, and I now
understand that the distress which well-nigh overcame
me was caused for the most part by my foolishly
dwelling upon the lack of water, whereas if I had
forced myself to think of other matters, much pain
might have been avoided.
</p>

<p>
It was impossible to force the oxen across the creek,
and we were obliged to make camp on the easterly
side, for it seemed as if they would never have done
with drinking.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56'>[56]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When they were so full that it was impossible to
swallow another mouthful, they refused to cross, but
struggled to get among the rich grass which covered
the bottom lands of the creek.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-057.jpg" width="495" height="419" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
After the horses, as well as the men and the cattle,
had been thus refreshed, half a dozen of our people,
among whom was Eben Jordan, rode back on the trail,
hoping to drive in some of the cows that had fallen
by the wayside. It was not until a late hour in the
evening that they returned, bringing with them only
two of the animals.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57'>[57]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Thus we suffered our first loss on the journey, and it
seemed to me a most serious matter; but even before
we had come to the trail which led to California, the loss
of even twice as many cattle could not have disturbed
me, for I had come to believe that we should arrive
at that Land of Promise, if indeed we were so fortunate
as to survive, almost empty-handed, owing
to the difficulties of the way which the beasts could
not overcome.
</p>

<p>
The next day's march was ended early in the afternoon,
because then we had come to a stream, and those
who were familiar with the trail knew we could not
arrive at another place where water would be found
until late in the night.
</p>

<h2>
MAKING BUTTER
</h2>

<p>
So we encamped early, and mother decided to set
about churning, for long ago our store of butter had been
exhausted. We had but a small quantity of cream,
all of which had been saved since morning.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had she begun her work than fully
half the women of the company followed her example,
and at the side or in the rear of nearly every wagon was
a churn set out with either the girls or the boys working
the dasher.
</p>

<p>
As Eben Jordan said when he offered to spell me at
the churn, it looked as if we people, who had set out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58'>[58]</a></span>
from Ashley to find a new home in the land of
California, had decided to abandon the idea and
turn all our attention to making
butter.
</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src="images/i-059.jpg" width="309" height="413" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Next morning we were
forced to continue the journey
before having breakfast,
for we were nearing
the Kansas River, and
would arrive there about
noon if the march was
begun as soon as daylight.
Even then
there would be hardly
more than time before
the sun set to
get all our train over, for the
stream was so deep that it could
not be forded, and we must send the wagons across in
boats.
</p>

<h2>
A KANSAS FERRY
</h2>

<p>
Although we were, as one might have supposed, in
an uninhabited country, father told me that at this
crossing of the Kansas River was a ferry owned by two
half-breed Indians, who made a business of freighting
heavy wagons across for a fee of one dollar each; but
all the live stock would be forced to swim.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59'>[59]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Now since none of the boats could carry more
than one wagon at a time, you may readily understand
how many hours would be needed in order to get
all our train from one side of the river to the other,
even though it was no more than two hundred yards
from bank to bank. Therefore, as I have said, it was
necessary we arrive at the ferry at
the earliest possible moment, lest night
overtake us while half
the company yet remained
on the eastern shore.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-060.jpg" width="502" height="351" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
The ferryboats were nothing more than square,
shallow boxes, which the Indians pushed across by
poles, after the cargo of wagons had been put on
board.
</p>

<p>
Of course the women and the girls had nothing to do
with this ferrying, save to remain under the wagon
coverings where they would be out of the way. I
envied Eben Jordan, who could move about at will, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60'>[60]</a></span>
verily my heart was in my mouth, so to speak, during
all the time we were working our slow way across the
stream, fearing lest our boat should sink beneath us.
</p>

<h2>
THE SURPRISE AT SOLDIER CREEK
</h2>

<p>
Not until nearly six o'clock were all our company
on the western side of the river, and then I supposed
that we would immediately make camp; but to my
surprise word was given for the train to move on, and
we journeyed three miles more, coming to the bank of
Soldier Creek before darkness.
</p>

<p>
It was at this place that a most pleasant surprise
awaited us. Colonel Russell's wife, who had walked
ahead while our train was being ferried across the
river, found quantities and quantities of wild strawberries
near the camping place. As soon as we women
and girls arrived, we set about gathering the berries,
until each family had a good supply of the luscious
fruit. Milk was not a poor substitute for cream to
us who had been living upon corn bread and salt meat
ever since we left the settlement of Independence.
</p>

<p>
During the next two days we traveled steadily
onward, slowly, to be sure, but yet each step, as Ellen
said again and again, was taking us nearer the end of
the journey. In time I came to be impatient whenever
a halt was called, so eager was I to have done with
riding, for however comfortable a girl might make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61'>[61]</a></span>
herself in one of the wagons, her limbs were certain
to become cramped before night.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-062.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
On the third day after crossing the Kansas River,
the leaders of our company decided that a halt was
needed in order to give the animals a rest. Their
hoofs had become dry and cracked from traveling
over the matted grass of last year, which covered the
prairie even beneath the new crop, and it was necessary
that something be done for them without delay.
</p>

<p>
I had been looking forward to a full day's halt, even
though impatient when we were not moving forward,
for Ellen and I had planned to wander as far from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62'>[62]</a></span>
encampment as we could, searching for flowers and
wild peas, which grew there in great abundance, so
we had been told.
</p>

<h2>
BREAD MAKING
</h2>

<p>
Mother decided that now had come a time when
she must bake a plentiful supply of bread, for she was
determined not to be put to such straits as we were
during the rain storm, when it was next to impossible
to build a fire in the stove, and, of course, I was glad
to do whatever I might to aid her.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-063.jpg" width="494" height="331" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Before father had fairly got the stove out of the
wagon and set up where it could be most conveniently
used, nearly every other woman in the company had
decided to follow mother's example, and then came such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63'>[63]</a></span>
a scene as was presented when each family did its
churning.
</p>

<p>
In the rear or at the side of nearly every wagon a
stove was set up, and one might see everywhere women
rolling or kneading dough, girls running about on
errands, and boys doing their share by keeping the
fires going.
</p>

<p>
I must say to Eben Jordan's credit that he was of
great assistance to mother and me that day. If he
had been a saint upon earth, he could not have done
more or worked with greater patience than he did,
running from stove to stove when the other boys had
neglected their duties.
</p>

<p>
Mother told him laughingly that many times while
we lived in Ashley she had been vexed because of
the boyish pranks he played; but from this time
onward she should remember what he had done in
the way of aiding the cooks, and would overlook almost
anything which mischief might prompt him to do.
</p>

<h2>
PRAIRIE PEAS
</h2>

<p>
The baking came to an end, so far as our family
was concerned, shortly after noon; then Ellen and
I, taking Eben with us as guide and protector, went
out in search of peas and brought home enough to
supply several families, who had been neighbors of
ours, with a generous mess.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64'>[64]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Save for the fact that these prairie peas look somewhat
like those we have at home, I could find no likeness
between the two varieties. The wild peas have a
tough rind, and there are several seeds in the middle
of each; but after they have been boiled and allowed
to remain in vinegar a
few hours, they make
a fairly pleasing dish.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-065.jpg" width="504" height="416" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
When we began the march once more, I hoped to see
the cattle moving more spiritedly than before the halt;
but in this I was mistaken. It seemed to me that they
limped painfully, and worse than ever; that I was not
mistaken was proved, to my satisfaction at least,
when I heard father and another man saying to each
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65'>[65]</a></span>
other that before many days we should be forced to
kill two or three whose feet were in the worst condition.
</p>

<p>
However, the days went on and our cattle continued
to work fairly well, although I noticed that when we
came to rough places, such as the crossing of a stream,
where it was necessary to climb a high bank on the
opposite side, the drivers were forced to double up the
teams more often than before, because the poor creatures
could not haul so heavy a load as when we first
started out.
</p>

<h2>
EBEN AS A HUNTER
</h2>

<p>
Within a week from the time of leaving Soldier
Creek, Eben Jordan was indeed puffed up with pride.
He came into camp late one afternoon dragging
behind him an antelope which he had shot
within two miles of where we halted an
hour previous. This proof that he had
shown himself a skillful hunter, caused
the boy literally to swell with joy as he
strutted around the body of
the beautiful animal
while our people
were looking at it.
</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src="images/i-066.jpg" width="309" height="263" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
It seemed too bad to kill such an innocent creature
as that antelope, and yet I forgot all the cruelty of
it when Eben brought to our wagon enough steaks
to provide all of us with a slice of fresh meat. Afterward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66'>[66]</a></span>
it seemed to me much as if we had been
cannibals when we so eagerly devoured the handsome
animal.
</p>

<p>
From that day on, whenever we made camp before
dark, Eben went out with his rifle, and more than once
he brought in a deer of some kind, dividing the meat
generously and fairly among us all.
</p>

<h2>
A HERD OF BUFFALOES
</h2>

<p>
Then came the time when we had our first glimpse
of buffaloes, and never shall I forget the scene. We
had been traveling in the bottom lands where we
found multitudes of paths deeply cut into the ground,
which some of our people said had been made by
buffaloes; but we girls never so much as dreamed we
might be near the beasts, until one morning father
called me hurriedly to look out of the wagon.
</p>

<p>
Then I screamed, for we were literally surrounded by
thousands upon thousands of those fierce-looking, yet
stupid, beasts, who gave no more heed to our encampment
than if they had been accustomed to such things
all their lives.
</p>

<p>
They circled around within a quarter of a mile of
where our cattle were feeding, and father said afterward
that unless our men had been exceedingly watchful and
active, the oxen and cows would have been stampeded
beyond a doubt.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67'>[67]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
EXCITEMENT IN THE CAMP
</h2>

<p>
Our animals were in a high state of excitement,
striving to get through the lines of men who guarded
them, and of course there was no possibility of our
breaking camp until the buffaloes had departed, for,
so father said, there was not a driver in the company
who could handle half a dozen yoke of oxen while the
buffaloes were so near.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-068.jpg" width="498" height="275" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Not all our people stood gazing stupidly at this sea
of animals as did Ellen and I. You may be certain
Eben Jordan was among the first to go out dangerously
near the huge beasts, and he was followed by all the
men of the company, save those who were guiding our
live stock.
</p>

<p>
I had supposed that the buffaloes would take to their
heels when a rifle was discharged; but much to my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68'>[68]</a></span>
surprise they paid little or no attention at first to the
reports of the firearms.
</p>

<p>
I dare not venture to say how many of the animals
were killed; but certainly it seemed to me, when about
noon the entire herd rushed off, the rumbling of their
hoofs on the hard earth sounding like thunder, that there
were no less than fifty carcasses spread out on the plain
within a mile of where our wagons had been drawn up
to form a corral.
</p>

<h2>
A FEAST OF BUFFALO MEAT
</h2>

<p>
There was so much game for us to bring in, that
during the remainder of the day every man and boy
that could be spared was kept busy at work skinning
the dead buffaloes or cutting up the flesh.
</p>

<p>
What a feast we had that evening! We had buffalo
tongues baked in the ovens, or in front of small fires
which had been built here and there. Then there were
what father called hump ribs, steaks, and meat of every
kind that could be taken from a buffalo. Each member
of the company was eager to learn how every eatable
portion of the animal tasted, and, therefore, cooked two
or three times as much as could be used at one
meal.
</p>

<p>
Our people had no more than time to skin and cut
up the carcasses before dark; on the following morning
word was passed around that each family must dry, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69'>[69]</a></span>
smoke-cure, as much of the flesh as possible within
the next four and twenty hours.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-070.jpg" width="498" height="371" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Straightway every man, woman, and child set about
either slicing the meat as thin as it could be cut with
sharp knives, or putting together racks made of sticks,
on which the strips of flesh were to be hung and exposed
to the rays of the sun, as well as to the smoke of the
fires that were to be built directly beneath them.
</p>

<h2>
CURING THE MEAT
</h2>

<p>
It was disagreeable work, and yet we were all, even
to the smallest girl, content to do our part, knowing
that we were thus laying up food for the future when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70'>[70]</a></span>
it might not be possible to procure game, and when all
the stores we had brought with us from Pike County
had been eaten.
</p>

<p>
The arms of the men who acted as carvers were
stained with blood to the elbows, while the hands and
even the faces of the women and children who carried
the sliced meat to hang it on the framework of sticks,
were colored in the same way.
</p>

<p>
In addition to curing the meat in the sun and smoking
it, some of the men made what is called pemmican, a
most disagreeable looking mixture of flesh and fat
which I afterward came to eat greedily, when we had
nothing else with which to satisfy our hunger.
</p>

<p>
Pemmican is made by first drying the very thinnest
of thin slices of meat in the sun, until they are so hard
that it is possible to rub or pound them to a powder.
</p>

<p>
A bag is then formed of the buffalo skin, and into it
is packed powdered meat sufficient to fill it considerably
more than half full, after which tallow is melted and
poured into the bag until it can hold no more. Then
the entire mass is allowed to cool and harden. It is
then fit for eating, so father said; but mother, when the
time came that we were glad to have our portion of the
stuff, always boiled it so it might be served hot.
</p>

<p>
It is not appetizing to me, and because I have
seen the mixture prepared I can eat it only when I
am very hungry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71'>[71]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
A WASH DAY
</h2>

<p>
Two full days were spent in curing the meat and
making pemmican, and even then we did not continue
the journey immediately, for the work had brought
our clothing to such a condition that a day for washing
was absolutely necessary. Therefore we remained for
another twenty-four hours.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-072.jpg" width="496" height="444" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
We were encamped near a small stream where could
be had plenty of water for the animals, and on either
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>[72]</a></span>
side of this tiny creek, shortly after sunrise, could be
seen many fires, kettles, and washtubs.
</p>

<p>
What a tired girl I was when I stretched myself out
on mother's feather bed in the wagon that night! It
seemed to me that I had no more than closed my eyes
before I was asleep, and not until father was bustling
around inside the wagon next morning trying to build a
fire in the cookstove, did I awake.
</p>

<p>
Then the patter, patter of rain on the wagon covering
told that we were to be treated to another downpour
of water, and eager though I was to reach California,
I hoped most fervently we would remain in camp yet
longer.
</p>

<h2>
UNCOMFORTABLE TRAVELING
</h2>

<p>
It was really difficult for me to open my eyes, so
heavily did slumber weigh upon them, when I asked
father if he had any idea of setting off in such a
storm, at the same time reminding him how our beasts
had struggled through the mud during the last rain.
</p>

<p>
He laughingly told me that we would continue on the
trail, regardless of the weather; that a rain storm was
not to be compared in the way of discomfort with snow.
He said that unless we came to our journey's end before
the season of frost set in, we might never arrive, but
would be in danger of perishing, as others had who,
striving to reach California, had been overtaken by
winter among the mountains.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>[73]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"So long as the cattle are in condition to push on,
just so long shall we continue to march, regardless of
whether the rain falls or the sun shines," he said,
speaking very solemnly, and mother's face grew grave
as if she was already beginning to understand the
better what might be before us.
</p>

<p>
"There will be all too many days when we must
remain in camp; but now, after such a long rest, it
would be little less than wicked to remain
idle here simply because
it might be more
to our comfort."
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-074.jpg" width="314" height="318" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
There is little
need for me to explain
how disagreeable
it is to get
up in the morning and
attempt to keep a fire going
with wet fuel.
</p>

<p>
Everything was damp and uncomfortable to the
touch, and all the surroundings looked much as Ellen
and I felt when we helped mother prepare breakfast.
</p>

<p>
After that very unsatisfactory meal had been eaten,
for we had nothing save some half-fried bacon with
cold corn bread, not being able to make coffee because
the fire would persist in going out, the train was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74'>[74]</a></span>
started. Ellen and I, crouching in the rear end
of the wagon where the rain could not drive in upon
us, sat close to the stove, which now seemed warmer
than when we were trying to cook breakfast, and
talked of the future.
</p>

<p>
Of course I cannot set down all we said, for much
of it was foolish; but some of the conversation I have
remembered clearly even to this day.
</p>

<h2>
ELLEN'S ADVICE REGARDING THE STORY
</h2>

<p>
Ellen, when I had told her it was my intent to write
the story of our coming from Pike County, said that
it would not be proper for me to write anything about
what we saw or did while on the Oregon trail. We
were bound for California, and would not be upon
the direct road to that country until we had left
Fort Bridger.
</p>

<p>
It was her idea that I should begin the story with the
time when we turned from the trail leading to Oregon,
and set our faces directly toward California; but, as
has been seen, I nearly forgot her advice, and even now
it seems impossible to do exactly as she proposed.
</p>

<p>
I intend, however, in order to please her, to set
down only such matters as seem to me of the greatest
importance, and thereby hurry over a certain portion
of the march, beginning in earnest with the time
when we finally came to Fort Bridger.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75'>[75]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
INDIANS AND MOSQUITOES
</h2>

<p>
Now you must bear in mind, although I may not
speak of them again, that we were constantly meeting
with Indians. Hardly a day passed that we did not
come upon a village, meet a party of hunters, or receive
visits from groups of two, three, or four who came to
beg.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-076.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Strange though it may seem, we became accustomed
to the savages as one does to seeing a dog or a cat around
the house, and gave little or no attention to them save
when they made themselves disagreeable.
</p>

<p>
One other thing I will speak about now. Mosquitoes
and tiny flies, which seemed as fierce as tigers, were
with us all the time by day as well as by night.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76'>[76]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When we first left Independence, it was difficult
for me to sleep at night because of these insects, and
during the day I spent the greater portion of my time
striving to keep them off my hands or face. As the
journey progressed it seemed as if they became less
poisonous; but I suppose my body had become
accustomed to the wounds, and I gave little heed
to them except when the weather was exceedingly
warm.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-077.jpg" width="493" height="398" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Until we came among the foothills, which is to
say, after we left Fort Bridger, we found game in
abundance. What had been sport to Eben became
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77'>[77]</a></span>
now a real labor, and he sought for fresh meat only
when urged to do so by his father or some of us girls.
</p>

<p>
There were days when our men brought in no game
because they were unable to come across any; but we
were in a country abounding with deer, elks, buffaloes,
and even bears, and so did not suffer for food.
</p>

<h2>
PRAIRIE DOGS
</h2>

<p>
Even though I say nothing more regarding the
remainder of our journey over the Oregon trail, I must
speak of the little prairie dogs which we came upon
from time to time.
</p>

<p>
They live in villages, sometimes, as father has said,
several acres in extent, and their houses are holes in
the ground, with a top or extension, made of earth
which they have pushed up from beneath.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-078.jpg" width="477" height="236" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Eben Jordan declares, and several men in the company
who have talked with the trappers or hunters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78'>[78]</a></span>
say, that in every prairie dog's house may be found
a little gray owl, who has lodgings there, and oftentimes
with this owl is a rattlesnake. Now just fancy
the prairie dog, the owl, and the rattlesnake living
together! All I ever saw of the family was the dog,
and he is about the size of a large rat, with hair
which is a mixture of light brown and black in
color.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible for me to tell you how entertaining
these little creatures are. When we passed by the
villages you could see them scampering around and
barking. Again and again I have seen them playing
about or sitting on the top of their houses, giving no
heed to us until the wagon train was close upon them,
when the entire colony would pop into their holes with
every evidence of fear.
</p>

<p>
A moment later each little fellow would stick his
head out, his black, beadlike eyes glistening, while he
looked around as if asking whether or not you saw
how quickly he could get under cover when it pleased
him to do so.
</p>

<p>
I know of nothing more comical than these little
animals, and yet they look so much like rats that
I would greatly prefer to see them at a distance rather
than make any attempt at taming them, as Eben
Jordan declares is his intention to do as soon as he can
catch one alive.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79'>[79]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I have my doubts, however, about his being able
to catch one, unless he is cruel enough to wound it
first with a rifle ball.
</p>

<h2>
COLONEL RUSSELL'S MISHAP
</h2>

<p>
Just before we arrived at the Platte River, we
crossed a small creek, the bottom of which was exceedingly
soft; the men were forced
to double up the teams in order
to draw the heavy loads along,
and Colonel Russell's wagon upset in midstream, where
the water was two or three feet deep.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-080.jpg" width="501" height="330" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Now there was nothing comical in such a mishap,
and yet Ellen and I, who were standing on the bank of
the creek where we could see all that was going on,
laughed until I felt actually ashamed of myself.
It was all so ridiculous that I could not have kept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80'>[80]</a></span>
my face straight whatever might have been the
result.
</p>

<p>
If the accident had happened quickly, there would
not have been anything so very funny about it;
but, instead, the wagon toppled slowly, the men
striving meanwhile to prevent it from going entirely
over. In the heavy wagon were Mrs. Russell and
four children. We saw first
the youngest child, as if
some one had
tossed him out, come shooting
from the wagon and strike
the water. Then another child, and so on, one after
another, exactly like a lot of grasshoppers, until Mrs.
Russell herself appeared. Out they marched in the
same order, water streaming from their clothing, which
was bedaubed with mud.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-081.jpg" width="487" height="308" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Mother reproved Ellen and me severely for laughing
when our neighbors were suffering; but even as she
spoke the Russell procession passed along the edge
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81'>[81]</a></span>
of the bank, marking the way with mud and water,
and I noticed that it was all she could do to keep her
face straight while she scolded us.
</p>

<h2>
CHIMNEY ROCK
</h2>

<p>
When finally we crossed the Platte River, the men
of the company rejoiced, although I was unable to
learn why, except that it marked, as mother suggested,
the first stage of the journey, the second of which
would come to an end at Fort Bridger, and the third
in that land where we hoped to settle.
</p>

<p>
Not long after crossing this river we had a first
glimpse of that enormous mass which travelers speak
of as Court House Rock, which, so those who have
seen both say, looks from the distance not unlike the
Capitol at Washington. A few miles farther on we
saw another huge pile called Chimney Rock.
</p>

<p>
I doubt not but that both would have been well
worth the seeing, yet our desire to look at them more
closely was not gratified. The trail leads some distance
off, and when mother proposed to father that
we might halt for a day in order to get a nearer view
of the curiosities, he shook his head decidedly, saying,
almost gruffly, that we who were bent on finding new
homes had no time to fritter away in looking at this
odd thing or at that.
</p>

<p>
Eben Jordan, however, borrowing one of his father's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82'>[82]</a></span>
horses, rode off to Chimney Rock by himself, and
when he came back he told Ellen and me that we need
not shed many tears because of failing
to see it close at
hand, because it
was nothing more
than a lot of big
stones that
looked as if they
might have been carelessly plastered
together with mud.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-083.jpg" width="489" height="316" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Of course this couldn't be the fact; but Eben has
no eye for scenery and, I dare say, might turn his nose
up at what every one else would believe wonderful or
full of beauty.
</p>

<h2>
AT FORT LARAMIE
</h2>

<p>
Forty-eight days after leaving Independence we
came to Fort Laramie, which is more like a trading
post than like a fortification. It stands on the banks
of the river Platte, is owned by the American Fur
Company, and is six hundred and seventy-two miles
from Independence by the trail we came over.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83'>[83]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Just fancy! We had traveled nearly seven hundred
miles, the men of the company walking all the way;
yet during that time, with the exception of the mishap
to Colonel Russell's wagon and the loss of a few head
of cattle, we had come to no harm.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-084.jpg" width="484" height="392" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
At Fort Laramie we slept in a real house for the first
time since starting on the long journey. It was not
such a building as we lived in at Ashley, and yet it was
to me almost beautiful, after I had remained so long
in the wagon.
</p>

<p>
I fancied I would sleep on that night as never
before since the march began, and that we would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84'>[84]</a></span>
have supper and breakfast properly and conveniently
served.
</p>

<p>
I had supposed the mosquitoes and the midges were
as thick in our wagons as it would be possible to find
them anywhere; but when we came into that house
the place was swarming with them, and they prevented
us from closing our eyes in rest during the entire night.
Never was a girl better pleased than I when the first
light of day came in through the windows.
</p>

<h2>
COOKING IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE
</h2>

<p>
After striving to cook food in front of one of the two
fireplaces in that house, I was actually ashamed of
having complained because our stove in the wagon on
a stormy morning had
seemed to me like
some contrary
animal.
</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src="images/i-085.jpg" width="401" height="365" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
However much
trouble we
might have
had with
wet fuel and
lack of draft
owing to the
shortness of
the stovepipe,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>[85]</a></span>
it was as nothing compared with those rude fireplaces,
where our faces were burned almost to a crisp, our
eyes filled with smoke, and whatever was cooking
came from the heat thickly incrusted with ashes.
</p>

<p>
I resolved not to grumble at anything we might find
in California, provided we had conveniences where we
could cook with some degree of comfort, and a place
in which to lie down where we would be protected from
insects.
</p>

<h2>
TRAPPERS, HUNTERS, AND INDIANS
</h2>

<p>
I suppose Eben might describe Fort Laramie so that
it would to a stranger present the appearance of a stronghold;
but for my part I saw there only scores upon
scores of savages, loitering around outside the walls,
gambling, racing horses, bartering furs, or gorging
themselves with half-cooked meat, while here and there
could be seen the noisy trappers, some dressed fancifully
after the fashion of the Indians, and others decked out
in buckskin clothing.
</p>

<p>
There were boasting hunters who swaggered around,
peering curiously under our wagon covers when we had
taken refuge there; and all around, corralled or feeding
near at hand, were cattle and ponies almost without
number.
</p>

<p>
Our company was not the only party of Pikers at
Fort Laramie. It seemed to me there must have been
three or four hundred who had been traveling as we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86'>[86]</a></span>
had traveled, some hoping to go into that land of
Oregon which was represented as being wondrously
beautiful, and others bound for California.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-087.jpg" width="496" height="485" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Ellen and I would have visited among the strange
Pikers had it not been for the throngs of trappers,
hunters, and
Indians, such as I
have already written
about. Mother
declared it would be well
for us girls to stay in our wagon, and this she came
to believe firmly after two of the trappers engaged in
a downright battle wherein both used knives, and
both were sorely wounded.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87'>[87]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The people round about did not appear to think this
fighting wicked or strange, and instead of endeavoring
to make peace among them, all, even a few women,
stood around watching the fray as if it was some
exhibition of an innocent nature.
</p>

<p>
I was sick with the sights of Fort Laramie even
before mother sent Ellen and me to the wagon, and
felt well content to remain there until next morning,
never grumbling when I struggled to keep a fire going in
the stove in order that we might cook supper.
</p>

<h2>
ON THE TRAIL ONCE MORE
</h2>

<p>
It seemed to me that every member of our company,
with the possible exception of Eben Jordan,
was delighted when the word had been passed around
during the evening that we should pull out at early
daybreak.
</p>

<p>
We were getting near to that forking of the trail
where we would bear southward and then westward,
passing around a great salt sea on our way to California.
</p>

<p>
We soon came among the foothills, and it was really
a relief to be climbing up one hill and sliding down
another, instead of driving over a level plain where
was nothing to vary the monotony. Although Ellen
and I were pleased with this change in the appearance
of the country, our fathers found little in it to give
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88'>[88]</a></span>
them pleasure, for we had come to where grass was
scanty and the way difficult for the animals.
</p>

<p>
As father said, from then on we might suffer such
privations and hardships as we had not experienced
since leaving Independence; but that I could hardly
credit, for it did not seem to me possible we would
have more discomfort than when we were marching
in the rain, with the ground so soft that the cattle
could only with difficulty drag the wagon along.
</p>

<p>
I suppose our people did have some trouble in finding
grass for the animals; but we girls knew little regarding
such matters. Our work was to aid in preparing
the meals, and, as Ellen said, in keeping our minds as
cheerful as possible; these tasks we performed to the
best of our ability, without hearing very much of the
perplexities of the men, save when Eben Jordan came
to us with tales of trouble.
</p>

<h2>
INDEPENDENCE ROCK
</h2>

<p>
After leaving Fort Laramie the first thing which
particularly attracted my attention was a perfect
mountain of rock, fully a hundred feet in height and
more than a mile in circumference, father told me,
which stood near the Sweetwater River, between the
ranges of mountains which border the Sweetwater
Valley.
</p>

<p>
It was an "imposing work of nature," so Colonel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89'>[89]</a></span>
Russell said; but to me the most interesting thing
about it was that the first celebration of the Fourth
of July by a company of people bound to Oregon was
held at the place. On the rocks, as high up as one can
see, are a multitude of names, many, many hundreds,
some painted, and others cut into the soft stone by
those who had visited the place.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-090.jpg" width="477" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Another thing about Independence Rock which
causes me to remember it even
more than as "an imposing
work of nature,"
was that near it one could pick
up all the saleratus he needed, for there are veritable
ponds of it, where, so father said, water filled with the
salts had evaporated, leaving the saleratus itself in
pools which looked as if made of milk.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we came upon a great gap in the
mountain wall which is called the Devil's Gate;
through it flows a beautiful stream, on the banks of
which we found wild currants and gooseberries in
greatest abundance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90'>[90]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
ARRIVAL AT FORT BRIDGER
</h2>

<p>
About the middle of July we arrived at Fort Bridger,
where we were to turn off upon the California trail, and
where, if Ellen's advice had been followed, this story of
mine would have begun.
</p>

<p>
Why it should be called <i>Fort</i> Bridger I fail to understand,
for there are no signs of a fort about, but only
three or four miserable log huts in which live two
fur traders with
their trappers
and hunters.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-091.jpg" width="488" height="268" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
One might have believed it quite an important
place, however, because when we arrived there were
no less than five hundred Indians of the Snake tribe
encamped round about the log huts. Beyond them
on every hand could be seen wagon train after wagon
train of people who had come not only from Pike
County, but from Ohio and Indiana, as well as from
Illinois and Missouri, the greater number intent on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91'>[91]</a></span>
gaining the Oregon country, with perhaps two hundred
who were going to California.
</p>

<p>
Of course there were also at this place hunters and
trappers, traders coming from or going into Oregon or
California, Spaniards, Negroes, and red men, the greater
number of all this throng living in canvas tents, in
wagons or log huts, while the rest made shift as best
they might in the open air.
</p>

<p>
It was, like Fort Laramie, a place where Ellen and
I had best remain in the wagons, for no one could tell
what the savages might do if two girls wandered
among their lodges, and certainly
we had no desire to make their
acquaintance.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-092.jpg" width="486" height="450" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92'>[92]</a></span></p>

<p>
Here, as everywhere since leaving Independence,
we heard that song which by this
time had grown threadbare,&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
"My name it is Joe Bowers."
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The Negroes and the Spaniards, the
trappers and the hunters, were
all singing it, and the wonder to
Ellen and me was where so
many people could
have heard it.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-093.jpg" width="389" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<h2>
WITH OUR FACES
TOWARD CALIFORNIA
</h2>

<p>
After spending one day
at Fort Bridger we set
off early in the morning
with our faces turned toward
California, and our
hearts beating furiously. For
the first time since leaving home
it seemed as if we were really on
the journey.
</p>

<p>
The trail ran up hill or down, all the way, but there
was very little difference, so far as hardships were
concerned, from that which we had already experienced.
</p>

<p>
During the first three or four days our fathers had
no difficulty in finding grass and water in plenty for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93'>[93]</a></span>
the cattle, although there were times, of course, when
for mile after mile we passed through nothing but
sage grass, which even the oxen would not eat. Every
night during this time, we came upon a pleasant place
in which to camp, and, best of all, so Eben Jordan
thought, the game was abundant everywhere. When
he had shot a small bear and brought it into camp, it
seemed as if his cup of happiness was full. One might
have thought the lad had performed some wondrous
deed, from the way he strutted to and fro, repeating
marvelous accounts of his battle with the beast.
</p>

<h2>
AT BEAR RIVER
</h2>

<p>
It was when we came to Bear River that I began to
understand how different this trail was from the one
which we had been traveling.
</p>

<p>
Instead of finding a safe ford, we came upon a swiftly
running river, with a bed of rocks. So strong was the
current that when father waded in to drive the oxen
it was necessary for him to hold firmly to the bow of
the foremost yoke lest he be thrown from his footing;
the heavy cart pitched about until I was certain it
would be overturned even as had Mrs. Russell's.
</p>

<p>
Mother said that if such an accident should befall
us, it would be no more than a just punishment to
Ellen and me because we had laughed so rudely when
the Russell family were in trouble.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94'>[94]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
THE COMING OF WINTER
</h2>

<p>
Two days after leaving Fort Bridger we had the
first indication that winter was near at hand, even
though it was then July. That night the buckets of
water were crusted with ice a full half inch thick, and
upon the tops of the mountains which towered so high
above us snow had fallen.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-095.jpg" width="500" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
You can well fancy how we shivered while making
ready to cook breakfast. When the train had started,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95'>[95]</a></span>
Ellen and I crawled under the bed clothing, for it
seemed as if we were like to freeze, and no one knows
how long we might have remained had not mother
insisted that we should sit once more on the front seat,
where we could see the wondrous beauties everywhere
around us.
</p>

<p>
Just at that time we were traveling through what
seemed to be a mountain gorge; towering many
hundred feet above our heads on either side were
crags which had been formed in the most comical
figures. Some of them really looked like animals,
and I could see now and then the head of an elephant
or of a lion.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day father told us that we had passed
in the early morning, while Ellen and I were asleep, a
rock which looked so much like a beast that the
trappers had given it the name of the Elephant's
Statue.
</p>

<p>
During nearly two days we continued along these
rocky roads, with the mountains overshadowing us,
and in places the cliffs hanging so low that it seemed
as if the rumbling of our wagons must cause them to fall
upon our heads.
</p>

<p>
The next night we kept a fire in the cookstove
because of the heavy frost in the air; then we came to
a narrow pass between the mountains, where was a
gorge or chasm, so deep that we could readily believe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96'>[96]</a></span>
Eben Jordan when he said the people at Fort
Bridger told him the sun never penetrated to the
bottom.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-097.jpg" width="484" height="487" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
It was what is known as Ogden's Hole, and got its
name, according to one story, through being the death
place of a trapper by the name of Ogden, who had
hidden himself there from the Indians and was either
killed by them or starved to death, Eben was not
certain which.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97'>[97]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
UTAH INDIANS
</h2>

<p>
There among the mountains we met a party of
Utah Indians armed only with bows and arrows, and
they journeyed with us until we camped for the
night, counting as a matter of course upon our feeding
them.
</p>

<p>
The Utahs looked to me more manly than any other
Indians we had yet met. Surely they behaved themselves
in a seemly manner, for when supper had been
made ready, they seated themselves in a circle and
waited decently to be invited to partake of food.
</p>

<p>
On the following morning, after we had traveled
about two miles, we came upon mountains which
looked as if they were standing there to bar our
advance, and for the life of us neither Ellen nor I
could understand how it would be possible to continue
the journey.
</p>

<p>
Even the men of the company were perplexed, and
during half an hour or more the entire train was halted
while our people went first this way and then that,
seeking some trail over which we could pass.
</p>

<p>
Then Colonel Russell came back to where we were
waiting anxiously and said he saw a narrow trail
winding directly up over those enormous cliffs. When
he pointed it out to the other men, we girls overheard
what he said, and I could not repress a cry of fear,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98'>[98]</a></span>
for surely it did not seem as if any member of our
company could climb to such a height, over so narrow
a path, let alone trying to drive the oxen with the
heavy carts.
</p>

<h2>
A DANGEROUS TRAIL
</h2>

<p>
However, there was nothing to be done save attempt
the dangerous passage, unless, indeed, we were willing
to turn our faces toward Fort Bridger, admitting we
had been beaten.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-099.jpg" width="498" height="307" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
My heart was literally in my mouth when we began
that terrible climb among loose rocks, over a path so
narrow that it seemed, if the wheels of the wagon
slipped ever so little, we would be hurled to the bottom
of the cañon, which is another word for a deep
valley or a rift in the rocks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99'>[99]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The ascent was so steep that when we started no
less than twelve yoke of oxen were needed to each
wagon, and there was a steady, upward scrambling
climb of fully two miles; therefore you can well
understand how many hours
we spent in making that
short portion of the journey.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-100.jpg" width="498" height="474" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Only one wagon
was sent up the
trail at a time, lest
through some accident
it should run backward
and crush whatever might
be in its path.
</p>

<p>
Until we were upon
the side of the mountain
where the trail
pitched downward into the valley, I kept my eyes
tightly closed, not daring to look at that dreadful
depth into which the slightest mishap might plunge us.
</p>

<p>
When the panting oxen were brought to a standstill,
the fearful labor having been performed, Ellen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100'>[100]</a></span>
said that she had been so frightened she was actually
exhausted, and indeed the perspiration, caused no
doubt by fear, was streaming down her face when I
ventured to open my eyes in order to look around.
</p>

<p>
I can conceive of nothing more horrifying than that
journey, short though it was in point of distance, yet
so long while one was in a state of terror as to seem
almost endless.
</p>

<p>
In going down on the other side, but one yoke of
cattle was hitched to each wagon, and kept there only
in order to hold the tongue steady and thus steer the
huge cart, while the hind wheels were chained, so that,
not being able to turn, they might act as a drag to
prevent us from sliding swiftly to destruction.
</p>

<p>
Father said we had traveled no more than seven
miles when we had crossed that terrible mountain.
There we found ourselves in a valley green with grass,
where ran a small brook which was most pleasing to
look upon, since it told us that we would have water in
abundance. Coming upon such a spot after so much
horror, caused it to appear all the more beautiful.
</p>

<h2>
SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND ANTELOPE STEW
</h2>

<p>
Without knowing it at the moment of halting, we
made camp near two Indian lodges, where lived ten
or twelve of the Utah tribe; having gained so favorable
an impression of those savages when some of the members
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101'>[101]</a></span>
had visited our camp, Ellen and I, with Eben
Jordan, went among them, finding that they had set
themselves up for traders, counting upon the settlers
bound for the land of California, as customers. The
women showed us a store of powder made from sunflower
seeds, which had been parched and then pulverized;
this they offered in exchange for
food, or for ammunition. Ellen gave
a loaf of corn bread for perhaps a
quart of the stuff, and found it most agreeable to the
taste.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-102.jpg" width="487" height="379" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
That evening one of the men brought in a fat antelope,
and mother made our portion into as savory a stew as
I had eaten since we left Pike County. After that
delicious meal and with the pleasing knowledge that
we had come in safety over so terrible a road, I slept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102'>[102]</a></span>
that night as soundly as I should have slept in my own
bed at home.
</p>

<p>
It was decided that we would remain in that place,
which mother called the Happy Valley, for a day, in
order to give the cattle a long rest before they did more
mountain climbing, and the housewives took advantage
of the opportunity to wash clothing, bake bread,
and do up such small chores as were necessary.
</p>

<p>
Consequently all the young people were busily
engaged keeping the fires going, churning, or performing
such other tasks as were required, so that we gave
little heed to what was going on around us until, when
the forenoon was about half spent, Eben Jordan excitedly
called our attention to a huge column of smoke
which was rising from the mountains to the westward.
</p>

<h2>
A FOREST FIRE
</h2>

<p>
At first I gave little heed to the matter, thinking it
might betoken the location of some Indian village;
but within another hour, so strong was the wind, the
fire had been driven up over the summit of the huge
mountain at the foot of which we were encamped,
when straightway we had over our heads, as it were,
a canopy of flame and smoke which shut out the light
of day, causing it to appear as if night had come and
the clouds were ablaze.
</p>

<p>
Half-burned leaves and ashes were scattered upon us
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103'>[103]</a></span>
until we were literally powdered as if with dust, and the
men found it necessary to keep sharp watch over the
coverings of the wagons, lest an ember should drop
upon them.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-104.jpg" width="501" height="480" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
During all the remainder of the day and until nearly
morning, the fire raged with greatest fury; but, fortunately,
the flames did not come down into the valley.
When we set off next day, the cattle, much refreshed,
went on at a swift pace; but the air was yet so full of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104'>[104]</a></span>
smoke that my eyes ached, while the tears ran down
my cheeks in tiny streams.
</p>

<p>
Our way now lay along the foot of the range of mountains
which sloped down to the marshy plains bordering
that vast inland sea, which has always seemed so
mysterious to me because of being salt.
</p>

<h2>
THE GREAT SALT LAKE
</h2>

<p>
It was about noon when we had our first view of
the Great Salt Lake, and although I had never then
seen an ocean, I could not believe the existence of
anything more wondrous than that huge body of salt
water among the mountains.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-105.jpg" width="494" height="321" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Father says the lake is probably a full hundred miles
long, and at its widest part no less than sixty miles;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105'>[105]</a></span>
but this he knows only from that which he heard from
the hunters or trappers, therefore I am not setting
it down as positive information. It seems to me I
remember having read in one of my schoolbooks that
it is no more than seventy-five miles long and thirty
miles wide.
</p>

<p>
However, this much which father says is true:
that the lake has no outlet, and four barrels of its
water being evaporated, will produce nearly a barrel
of salt; therefore you can understand how much more
salty it is than a real ocean.
</p>

<p>
No fish can live in it, and Eben Jordan declared that
one of the trappers at Fort Bridger told him a man
could not sink beneath the surface, so buoyant is the
water.
</p>

<p>
The shore of this great inland sea was white with
a crust of soda or salt, and the odor which came from
the stagnant water in the marshes was so unpleasant
as to cause me to feel really ill.
</p>

<h2>
EBEN AS A FISHERMAN
</h2>

<p>
It was on this night, when we had our first view of
the Great Salt Lake, that Eben Jordan gave us a most
pleasing surprise. We had halted quite early in the
afternoon, and even before camp was made he disappeared;
but I gave no heed to the matter when I
heard his mother inquiring after him, for I thought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106'>[106]</a></span>
the boy had gone off to try his skill as a hunter
again.
</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src="images/i-107.jpg" width="411" height="417" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Two or three hours later, however, it appeared that,
instead of chasing deer or bears, he had turned
fisherman for the time being,
and when he came into camp
just before we began to get
supper, he had with him
seventeen of the most beautiful
trout you could
imagine, which he
had caught in
one of the mountain
streams.
</p>

<p>
They were
so large that
he literally
staggered
under the
weight, and the
single fish which he gave mother made an ample meal
for all our family. It surely was delicious, and while
eating it I made a mental resolve never again to speak
impatiently or angrily to Eben, whatever he might do,
for many times since our journey began he had been
very kind to us all.
</p>

<p>
It really began to seem as if, after we had turned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107'>[107]</a></span>
into the California trail, we were to come across everything
which was strange and wonderful, for next day,
after our train had rounded the base of one of the
mountains, we came upon six or seven springs of water
which was actually hot to the touch, as if on the point
of boiling, and which smelled so strongly of sulphur
that one would have been in danger of suffocation
had the fumes been inhaled.
</p>

<p>
Those odd springs seemingly came up out of the
solid rock, and mother, whose curiosity was so far
aroused as to induce her to taste of the water, said
it was bitter and most disagreeable; but she had no
doubt it might be well for us all to take fairly strong
doses by way of medicine.
</p>

<h2>
GRASSHOPPER JAM
</h2>

<p>
We were yet within sight of the Great Salt Lake
when, one evening, three Indian men and two squaws,
miserably clad and very ugly, came into camp bringing
for sale or barter something that looked much
like preserves.
</p>

<p>
Even though these people were so wretchedly dirty,
I was hoping mother might be induced to buy some
of their wares, so keenly did I hunger for something
sweet; but I speedily lost all desire for anything of
the kind, when one of the men in the company explained
what it was the Indians had for sale.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108'>[108]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It seems impossible human beings could eat such
things, and yet this man told me it was true that the
Indians gathered a fruit called service berries, crushed
them into jam and mixed the
pulp with grasshoppers that
had been dried over the fire
and then pounded to a powder.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-109.jpg" width="497" height="417" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
He called the stuff "Indian fruit cake," and, much
to my disgust, not only bought a generous portion,
paying for it with needles, powder, and bullets, but
actually ate the mixture. I could not bring myself
even to look upon it, after knowing what it really was.
</p>

<p>
Once more we came upon the mountains after leaving
the shores of Great Salt Lake, and again we climbed
up the steep ascents, with all the oxen toiling at a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109'>[109]</a></span>
single wagon, and then slipped down on the opposite
side, until it seemed certain some terrible accident
must befall.
</p>

<h2>
A DESERTED VILLAGE
</h2>

<p>
One night we came to another place much like the
one we had called the Happy Valley, and there we found
an Indian village of fifteen or twenty lodges, every one
deserted, although we knew the people could not be
far away, for fires were burning brightly in front of
the dwellings, dogs were barking, and many willow
baskets filled with service berries were standing about.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-110.jpg" width="493" height="285" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
It was a beautiful spot for a home, and I could
almost have wished father would settle there, rather
than continue on over a trail which was as dangerous
as the one spread out before us.
</p>

<p>
There were in the valley poplar and pine trees
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110'>[110]</a></span>
with many willows, and here and there a patch of
sunflowers shining out from the surrounding green
with a golden glory.
</p>

<p>
I had supposed our people would camp there; but
instead of doing so they continued on, planning to
spend the night on the higher land. When we were
halfway up the ridge which led out from the valley,
the Indians, whom we had evidently frightened, came
out from their hiding places, whooping and shouting
as if to scare us, although I saw no token that they
were bent on doing us mischief.
</p>

<p>
We camped on a slope of the ridge, down which ran
a small brook, and those who had tents set them up
in a grove of cedar trees where they looked most
inviting. When, however, Ellen and I strolled that
way we found the mosquitoes and midges so thick
that it seemed as if we had a veil in front of our
faces.
</p>

<p>
That night the men of our company gathered apart
from the women and children, seemingly to discuss
some important matter; my curiosity was so far
aroused that when I saw Eben Jordan I called upon
him for an explanation, and he told me that we had
come to the most dangerous part of our journey,
where we must encounter perils so great that those
which had already been overcome would seem as
nothing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111'>[111]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
THE GREAT SALT DESERT
</h2>

<p>
We were near what is known as the Great Salt
Desert; in fact, were to cross it on the morrow, and
when Eben Jordan led me some distance farther up
the ridge, I could see it at my feet.
</p>

<p>
The desert is covered with salt like sand, and on it
grows nothing except wild sage, while from where we
were then camped, until it would
be possible again to find water,
is no less than sixty miles,
as Eben said.
</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src="images/i-112.jpg" width="309" height="333" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Sixty miles over a
soft surface where
the animals would
oftentimes sink fetlock-deep,
and the
wheels of the wagons
plow into the salt
sand until the progress
must be woefully slow.
In addition, all the while we would plod along knowing
that no water was to be had, save what we carried
with us, until the train gained the opposite side.
</p>

<p>
We were camped on the side of a mountain which
seemed to be made up almost wholly of rock; this
place had been decided upon because there could be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112'>[112]</a></span>
found a small spring, yielding barely enough water to
satisfy the desires of ourselves and the animals.
</p>

<p>
It was the last spring or stream of fresh water we
should come upon until we had traveled across that
desert, which, from the distance, looked like a great
sea of milk. Once we had started upon the journey,
it would be necessary to continue on, heeding not
those who might fall by the way, so I heard father
and Colonel Russell say, for the lives of our people
depended upon our going steadily forward.
</p>

<h2>
PREPARING FOR A DANGEROUS JOURNEY
</h2>

<p>
Orders were given by the leaders of the party that
our mothers cook no pemmican nor any salted food,
lest it increase our thirst, and we ate bread with as
much milk as could be had from the cows; within
a few hours, for we were to set off again at midnight,
another meal, consisting wholly of bread made from
corn meal, would be served.
</p>

<p>
The water of the spring was so salty as to be almost
undrinkable. During the evening the women and
girls were busily engaged making coffee, for in such
form the water was a trifle more palatable, and we were
advised to fill with the coffee every vessel that would
hold liquid.
</p>

<p>
As for the cattle, they would be forced to make the
march of sixty miles with nothing to drink save what
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113'>[113]</a></span>
could be carried in two casks which had been bought
at Fort Bridger for that especial purpose.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-114.jpg" width="490" height="414" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
When I asked father how it would be possible for
us to give the animals drink even once, from no more
than sixty gallons of water, he said they were not intending
to allow
the poor creatures
to have
what they wanted.
The supply of water
would be used simply to
moisten the mouths of those that were suffering
most severely. There could be no question whatsoever
but that the live stock would be in great
misery, and if it so chanced that we people escaped
dire distress, then indeed we should hold ourselves
fortunate.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114'>[114]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
BREAD AND COFFEE MAKING
</h2>

<p>
Fortunately Ellen and I had little time in which
to borrow trouble concerning the future, for every
woman and girl found plenty with which to occupy
her hands, as we prepared for the most dangerous and
disagreeable portion of all the journey.
</p>

<p>
We made corn bread in abundance, cooking no less
than three times as much as we could eat, for Colonel
Russell suggested that it was possible we might abate
the thirst of the animals by giving them bread in
small quantities during the march, and so we filled
every available place in the wagon with this food.
</p>

<p>
Mother made coffee enough to provide us with a
supply on that night, as well as for breakfast, and,
in addition, we had filled to the brim every vessel
which was water-tight, until I should think we must
have had no less than three gallons, while every other
wagon was equally well supplied.
</p>

<p>
The men and boys were not idle while we baked the
corn bread and made coffee. They had enough and
plenty with which to occupy their time, for every
piece of harness, every yoke bow, wheel, or other
portion of the outfit which might give way, was looked
after carefully, lest there be a delay, because a halt on
the desert, so we had been told at Fort Bridger, might
mean death to us all.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115'>[115]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
That night the animals were corralled inside our
circle of wagons in order that they might be ready
when the hour came for us to set off, and for the first
time since I had known Eben Jordan I saw an expression
of anxiety upon the lad's face.
</p>

<p>
Wherever one looked among our people he could see
gloomy faces, and there was no more singing of "Joe
Bowers," no whistling and joking among the lads, as
was usually the case during an evening in camp.
</p>

<h2>
BREAKING CAMP AT MIDNIGHT
</h2>

<p>
When midnight came, I had a very good idea that
there was more danger to be met in crossing the desert
than I had been willing to believe, for we were awakened
and told that the march would be begun in half an
hour.
</p>

<p>
Father urged mother and us girls to eat and drink
heartily while we might. When I asked him why
we were to set off at such an unusual hour, he replied
in a serious manner that from the moment we started
until the desert had been crossed, there would be no
halt made unless some of the oxen fell by the wayside
and we were forced to delay in order to unyoke
them.
</p>

<p>
When Ellen asked him how long a time the crossing
would take, he said he hoped no more than twenty or
twenty-four hours. He also told us it had been agreed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116'>[116]</a></span>
that if one of the wagons should break down, or any
accident happen, the unfortunate ones were to be left
behind, the remainder of the company continuing on
without making any effort to aid them.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-117.jpg" width="499" height="297" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Then, perhaps for the first time, I began to realize
how much danger lay before us. Surely if our fathers
had agreed that during the coming march they would
make no halt for any reason, there must be grave cause
for fear.
</p>

<p>
The men made ready for the march by the light of
the moon, and there were yet no signs of the coming
day when we set off; and then we were a mournful
party indeed, the drivers urging their beasts to the
utmost, as if they realized that every moment was
precious.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117'>[117]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
THE APPROACH TO THE SALT DESERT
</h2>

<p>
There was nothing very dreadful to be seen on the
first six miles of the march, for then we were winding
our way up the ridge, on the side of which we had been
encamped, and save for the fact that Ellen and I were
suffering from the cold, the journey was much the
same as we had already known.
</p>

<p>
Then we rode down the other side of the ridge,
among stunted cedar trees which looked as if they were
dying from lack of water, and Eben Jordan came past
our wagon to say we had come upon Captain Frémont's
trail.
</p>

<p>
The fact that we were to follow in the footsteps of
other human beings gave me more courage and caused
Ellen to appear almost cheerful.
</p>

<p>
We crossed a valley where nothing was growing save
wild sage, and then over rocky ridges which looked
much like masses of dark green glass, through a narrow
gap which might have been cut by the hand of man
in the solid ledge, after which we saw spread out
before us that vast desert plain, white as a sea of milk
and most desolate and forbidding in appearance.
</p>

<h2>
A PLAIN OF SALT
</h2>

<p>
Not a vestige of any green thing could be seen
within our range of vision. No bird was flying, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118'>[118]</a></span>
the silence was so like the silence of the tomb that I
did not dare to speak aloud while calling mother's
attention to this thing or that, when we halted for
a short time.
</p>

<p>
This was the last stop we would make, save in case
of accident. Some of the animals ate the bread, others
refused it, and then I saw what would
have been, under other circumstances,
a comical sight, for the men
were going about with wet
cloths moistening
the mouths of the oxen.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-119.jpg" width="494" height="274" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
After spending nearly an hour in making the final
preparations, word was given for the train to set off.
Instead of being like milk, we found that the desert
was made up of a bluish clay, covered here and there
in blotches with what was much like salt, and these
white spots were so large and numerous as to give to
the whole the appearance of milky white when seen
from the distance.
</p>

<p>
The oxen sank fetlock-deep, and as we advanced
there were times when they broke through what was like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119'>[119]</a></span>
a crust, even to their very knees; therefore one can well
fancy that the wheels plowed into this yielding surface
until it was quite as much as the cattle could do to
pull the wagons along.
</p>

<h2>
LIKE A SEA OF FROZEN MILK
</h2>

<p>
If all the way had been as difficult as the start, we
might never have gained the other side; but as we
advanced the surface grew harder and harder, until
finally even the shoes of the horses failed to make any
impression upon it. Then I heard father say, as he
came back from time to time to speak with mother,
that it appeared to him as if we were traveling over a
solid crust of salt.
</p>

<p>
At the end of an hour, perhaps, we came upon what
Ellen called another "soft spot," and for a distance of
two or three miles the oxen strained and tugged at the
yokes as they barely succeeded in drawing the wagons
at a snail's pace.
</p>

<p>
Then we girls had most terrible forebodings, for it
seemed certain we could never hope to cross that place
before all the company had died from thirst.
</p>

<p>
To our great relief as well as the relief of the cattle,
we came upon a hard surface once more, and the
oxen were urged to their utmost speed in order to make
up for the time we had lost while toiling through the
salty dust.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120'>[120]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was no halting for dinner. Now and then we
ate the corn bread, for with such terrible anxiety in our
hearts none of us were conscious of hunger; but again
and again and again did we sip the cold coffee, using it
sparingly, however.
</p>

<h2>
SALT DUST
</h2>

<p>
It was nearly ten o'clock in the forenoon when a dark
cloud began to gather in the south, and I said to mother,
with great joy, that we would
at least know the pleasure of being
wet, even though we could not get all we wanted to
drink, for surely there was a shower close upon us.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-121.jpg" width="504" height="316" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Indeed, we did have wind, with thunder and lightning,
but not a drop of water fell. On the contrary, the
breeze stirred up the dust from the plain and filled the
air with it, and our parched throats grew yet more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121'>[121]</a></span>
dry because of the salt which we were forced to inhale,
even though we covered our faces with cloths.
</p>

<p>
How the poor beasts suffered! Their tongues were
actually covered with salt, and not a mouthful of
water could they have as a relief from their distress.
</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src="images/i-122.jpg" width="318" height="329" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Save for the absence of rain, it was a veritable
tempest of thunder and lightning,
lasting about twenty minutes;
then the sun came out with
more heat, as it seemed to me,
than before, which but
served to increase
our desire for water.
</p>

<p>
When the sun
was no more than
three hours from
setting, I strained my
eyes ahead, hoping to
see the end of this horrible
journey, although mother had told me there was no
possibility of our coming to water until late in the
night, and I saw the foremost of the wagons leaving
the white plain, and passing over what promised to be
a good road, toward a rocky range.
</p>

<p>
Then I shouted aloud in my joy, that we would soon
come to where it would be possible to quench our
thirst.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122'>[122]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT
</h2>

<p>
For the moment mother believed I was right, but then
Eben Jordan dampened our joy by telling us that we
must ride over the ridge five or six miles, where were no
signs of water, and then we would come upon another
plain of salt, which was not less than
twelve miles in width. Only after
that had been crossed might we find
ourselves in safety.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-123.jpg" width="475" height="341" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Ellen threw herself
face downward
upon the
bed in the
bottom of the wagon, and lay there as if in a fit of
the sulks, while I crouched by mother's side, wondering
how long it would be before death came, for I had grown
so foolish in my sufferings that it was as if life was
nearly at an end.
</p>

<h2>
COFFEE INSTEAD OF WATER
</h2>

<p>
Mother left us to ourselves during half an hour or
more, and then told us plainly that we were showing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123'>[123]</a></span>
ourselves to be very foolish girls. She insisted that we
eat the harder portions of the corn bread; that we take
frequent drinks of the coffee, and, above all, that we
resolutely calm our minds.
</p>

<p>
It must have been that amid all my distress I fell
asleep, for suddenly I heard, as though coming from
afar off, shouts of joy and the voices of men calling one
to another.
</p>

<p>
Starting up, I asked mother what was happening,
and gazed around wildly, for night had come and the
moon was not yet risen.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God! the desert has been crossed, and we
have come at last to where water may be obtained!"
my mother cried fervently.
</p>

<p>
She leaped out of the wagon, we two girls following,
and, running hurriedly, we went to where the men,
boys, and animals had gathered in a group.
</p>

<p>
I believed we had come to a stream of sweet water,
but it was only a narrow brook, where ran hardly
more than a thread of water which had already been
trampled upon by the animals until it was like liquid
mud.
</p>

<h2>
A SPRING OF SWEET WATER
</h2>

<p>
At this moment Eben Jordan, taking Ellen and me
by the hands, said, forcing us to run with him:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"By following the stream to its head we shall surely
come upon a spring."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'>[124]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And this we did, finding within two hundred yards
a spring of the sweetest water I have ever taken into
my mouth.
</p>

<p>
Ellen and I drank again and again, seemingly never to
be satisfied, and it was only after I had shown myself
very selfish that I remembered
poor mother, who, most
likely, was standing by that muddy stream waiting
until the water had grown clear so she might drink.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-125.jpg" width="494" height="325" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Then Eben Jordan went back, and a few moments
later returned, bringing with him all the women and
children, and many of the men.
</p>

<p>
Having drunk our fill, Ellen and I went back to the
wagon, where we ate heartily of corn bread, and then
laid ourselves down to sleep, while the men and boys
were bringing the teams into a circle to form a corral.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125'>[125]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
THE OASIS
</h2>

<div class='figright'>
<img src="images/i-126.jpg" width="272" height="311" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
After this we remained idle thirty-six hours, being
forced to do so, as father said, because the animals
were so nearly exhausted that a long time of rest was
absolutely necessary.
</p>

<p>
It was during this time that Eben Jordan again
displayed his skill as a hunter, for toward nightfall he
brought in two small antelopes; but the animals
were so tiny that each family had no
more than half enough to satisfy
their craving for fresh meat, and
we were forced to complete the
meal with bacon.
</p>

<p>
Our halting place was on what
can be described only as
an oasis, stretching from
that sea of white to the
rocky cliffs beyond, and
father told us that while
we would not be forced to march over a plain of salt
during the next day, the journey would be exceedingly
wearisome and our suffering considerable, for another
entire day must be spent without water.
</p>

<p>
Again we made preparations for a time of distress,
by boiling more coffee and filling up the water casks
with sweet water from the spring.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126'>[126]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This time the anticipation was worse than the
reality. On resuming the march, we traveled over
the side of the barren ridge more than twelve miles,
until we came to a well-defined wagon trail which, so
some of our people said, had first been made by
emigrants from Missouri.
</p>

<p>
I gave little heed as to who might first have passed
over the trail, rejoicing with Ellen that at last we had
come to some evidence of human beings; it seemed
as if our troubles were well-nigh at an end, for we were
told that this trail would lead us by the most direct
course into that land of California where we hoped
to find rest and comfort.
</p>

<h2>
SEARCHING FOR WATER
</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-128.jpg" width="500" height="441" alt="" />
</div>
<p>
From this on, during four wearisome days, we were
kept upon a short allowance of water, and did not
dare eat much food lest it should unduly excite our
thirst.
</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src="images/i-129.jpg" width="153" height="500" alt="" />
</div>


<p>
Now and then we came upon a spring, when our
water casks and every vessel that could be used for
the purpose were filled to the brim, and yet again and
again we suffered from thirst, but not so keenly as while
crossing the desert.
</p>

<p>
Whenever I slept, it was to dream of the river we had
left behind us on the border of Pike County, wishing
that it might be possible for me to go to its banks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127'>[127]</a></span>
once more, and, even though the water was muddy,
drink my fill.
</p>

<p>
In due time we came to that point in the trail where
we were forced to march directly over the face of
the mountains. Here our fathers
found the way
so difficult that
once more the teams were
doubled up, twelve or fifteen
yoke of cattle being put
on one wagon, and, after
hauling the heavy load to the summit of the range,
driven back to get another.</p>


<p>
Of course our progress was slow, and we traversed
mile after mile only with severe labor on the part of
the men and boys, for we girls and the women did no
more than walk in order to lessen the load.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128'>[128]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then we came to a narrow
passage amid the rocks, which
was most frightful to look
upon, although there was
nothing whatever about it to
cause alarm.
</p>

<p>
It was a gorge or cañon
much like a tunnel, where the
light from above was like a
slender silver thread, and we
went down into a narrow defile,
where was barely room for the
wagons to pass, and where the
rocks, dark and fearsome, rose
hundreds of feet above our
heads.
</p>

<h2>
THE BEAUTIFUL VALLEY
</h2>

<p>
When we had passed through
that forbidding place we received
our reward, for we came
into a most beautiful valley
with water and grass in abundance,
and, although it was
yet early in the afternoon, there was no thought of
anything save making camp, that we might enjoy the
blessings which were spread out before us.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129'>[129]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Before the sun had set Eben Jordan had killed another
antelope; but he did not dare go far from the
encampment in search of other game, for no sooner
had twilight come than we could hear the howling of
the wolves around us, until one's very blood ran cold.
It seemed certain, and indeed was a fact, that we were
literally surrounded by those
ravenous animals,
which were kept at a
respectful distance only by
the glare of our camp fires.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-130.jpg" width="496" height="329" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Next day, when we took up the line of march again,
it was the same old story of climbing over rocky ridges
and descending into valleys where could be found no
signs of vegetation, until we had come to a very network
of streams.
</p>

<p>
At our next camp we were visited by a party of
Snake Indians, who, like the other savages we had seen,
pressed around us, begging for bits of bread.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130'>[130]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
SNAKE INDIANS
</h2>

<p>
Those Indians were not at all like any we had seen
before; their clothing, what little there was of it,
consisted mostly of rabbit skins sewed together to
form cloaks. To my mind they resembled more the
Negroes than the Indians; but father said, save for
their inclination to steal anything upon which they
could lay their hands, that we need have no fear whatever
regarding them, because they were known to be
peaceable. The men were armed only with bows
and arrows and seemed to have great fear of a gun
or a pistol.
</p>

<p>
The visitors had with them a quantity of dried meat
and roots which they wanted to trade with us for bread
or for blankets; but our store of provisions was not so
low that we would willingly eat what those creatures
had prepared.
</p>

<p>
They lingered around the encampment, however,
coming as closely to the wagons as our people would
permit, and we girls and boys were told to keep
careful watch lest they steal all our possessions.
</p>

<p>
Just at sunset, one of the men who was standing guard
over the cows shouted that a wild beast was creeping
up on us from a thicket a short distance away, to the
right of where father's wagon stood.
</p>

<p>
Looking up quickly, I saw a huge panther crawling,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131'>[131]</a></span>
as you might say, much as a cat approaches a mouse,
and it seemed to me that he was making ready to spring
directly upon us girls.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-132.jpg" width="498" height="377" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Ellen and I clambered shrieking into the wagon,
where we hid our heads in a feather bed like the silly
children we were, and straightway there ensued the
greatest tumult that can be imagined, as our hunters
strove to kill the ferocious animal.
</p>

<p>
It is, perhaps, needless for me to say that the panther
escaped, although Eben Jordan claimed it would have
been possible for him to kill the beast, had he not been
hampered by frightened girls and men.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132'>[132]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
A SCARCITY OF FOOD
</h2>

<p>
When the march was taken up once more, we journeyed
over a less forbidding, although a not very
pleasant, country, seeing antelopes at a distance, but
so wild that even Eben Jordan strove in vain to bring
one down.
</p>

<p>
During four or five days we marched westward, seeing
now and then great numbers of animals which would
have served to provide us with fresh meat, but our men
were unable to kill any; then we found our supply of
food growing so small that it was decided each person
should have at a single meal no more than one slice of
bacon and a piece of corn bread as big as a man's hand.
</p>

<p>
There is no good reason why I should set down such
mournful details. While we were pressing steadily but
painfully westward, so hungry that it seemed to me I
could have eaten anything resembling food, and thirsty
until my tongue was parched, the rays of the sun beat
down upon us with pitiless fury, until we were so worn
that life seemed at times like some frightful dream.
</p>

<p>
I can remember distinctly, however, what happened
on that day when we heard those who were leading
the train, shout that we had come upon water in
abundance. When Ellen and I, leaping out of the
wagon, ran forward, we saw before us several large
springs from which the water was bubbling generously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133'>[133]</a></span>
Our delight was even as great as the disappointment
was bitter, when the water was found to be almost
boiling hot.
</p>

<h2>
SPRINGS OF HOT WATER
</h2>

<p>
It seems hardly possible that any liquid could come
out of the earth so warm, and if I had never left
Pike County I would have set down
such a tale as a fable; but we did find
boiling water, so hot that
when Eben Jordan let
down into one of those springs a slice of bacon tied to
a string, it was well boiled in less than fifteen minutes.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-134.jpg" width="496" height="365" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
However, we were not to be deprived of water even
though it was hot, for father proposed that we fill
some of our cups, declaring it would be sweet to the
taste once it was cool.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134'>[134]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This we did not only once, but three or four times,
during the continuation of the march, for we came
upon many of those hot springs on the trail after
we left the banks of Mary's River.
</p>

<p>
Then came a day in August when, after an unusually
wearisome march, we suddenly overtook two emigrant
wagons in which were fourteen people who had come
from Missouri.
</p>

<p>
Verily it seemed as if old friends were meeting, for
as our train came in sight, some of the strangers began
to sing, "My name it is Joe Bowers," and however
weary I had once been of hearing that tune, it now
sounded in my ears like music.
</p>

<p>
That evening we spent visiting; those people,
like ourselves, were traveling toward the land of California,
and only those who have been journeying in
the desert and through the wilderness, without meeting
any human beings save Indians, can understand how
intent was the pleasure we experienced in being with
our own kind again.
</p>

<p>
The emigrants decided to join our train, and we
were right glad to have them with us, although their
store of provisions was no greater than ours; but all
were put on what father called "short allowance,"
which was to each person two slices of bacon and two
pieces of bread during one entire day. All our men
who had guns were continually searching for game;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135'>[135]</a></span>
but while we could see antelope and even wild fowl,
both beasts and birds were so shy that the best hunters
among us could not get within gunshot.
</p>

<h2>
IN THE LAND OF PLENTY
</h2>

<p>
And so we traveled on, hungry, thirsty, and weary,
despairing now and then of ever coming again into a
land of plenty, until we arrived at the Truckee River,
which was more beautiful to my eyes than ever had
been the broad Mississippi.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-136.jpg" width="491" height="321" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
The waters of the river were clear as crystal and
very cool, while from it our people took within an hour
a sufficient number of trout to satisfy the hunger of
all. It seemed necessary we should eat until it was
absolutely impossible to swallow more, in order to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136'>[136]</a></span>
atone in some way for the hunger that had pressed so
sorely upon us during the ten days previous.
</p>

<p>
Eben Jordan said laughingly that we were much
like the savages, who were starved one day and in
danger of bursting with food the next.
</p>

<h2>
THE TRUCKEE RIVER
</h2>

<p>
It pleased me right well when father said that we
were to remain in camp one full day by the side of this
river, in order to give the animals the opportunity of
feeding upon the rich grass which grew in abundance
on every hand.
</p>

<p>
At last we had come into California, and a beautiful
country indeed it appeared to me while we remained
near the river,&mdash;all the more beautiful, perhaps, because
of the suffering which it had cost us to get there. Both
Ellen and I now came to believe our fathers had been
wise indeed to leave the banks of the muddy Mississippi
for so glorious a river as the Truckee.
</p>

<p>
All around us were evidences of bountiful nature,
for the land was seemingly overcrowded with game,
with food on every hand for the cattle, beautiful
flowers, and everything which goes to make one happy.
</p>

<p>
How long the journey had been I did not really know
until Eben Jordan came to where Ellen and I were
sitting on the grass with the skirts of our gowns filled
with flowers. He had in his hands a bit of paper on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137'>[137]</a></span>
which he had set down, from what had been told him
by the leaders of the company, the distance we people
had traveled since leaving Independence. This was no
less than two thousand and ninety miles, to which one
must add, in order to learn how long was our march,
the distance from Pike County to Independence, which
would, so Eben said, make a total of about two thousand
two hundred.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-138.jpg" width="482" height="319" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Even then we were nearly two hundred miles from
San Francisco; however it was not the intention of our
fathers to journey so far across California, for we had
not come expecting to find gold, but to make for ourselves
farms, where we could live comfortably by
honest industry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138'>[138]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Already I am writing as if we had come to an end
of our journey, and so it seemed to me while we
remained in camp on the bank of the Truckee River;
but there were yet many days of toil before we
arrived at the place where our people had decided to
buy land.
</p>

<p>
It was yet necessary that we cross the Sierra Nevada,
where we found a seemingly impassable trail over the
mountains, yet we knew that people like ourselves,
traveling in the same way, had gone before us, and all
the dangers and the difficulties seemed lessened because
of the fact that we had come so near to where we
intended to make our new homes.
</p>

<h2>
A HOME IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY
</h2>

<p>
After much labor in descending the Sierras, we
came upon the first settler's house we had seen since
starting out. It stood in the valley of the Sacramento,
on what is called Bear Creek, and was owned by Mr.
Johnson, who himself was a Piker.
</p>

<p>
To me the house was odd looking, not because of
being so small as to have only two rooms, but because
it was built half of logs and half of adobes, or bricks
of mud which have been dried in the sun. It was a
rough building, and yet how homelike it appeared!
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately Mr. Johnson and his family were
not at home. The building was closed, and although
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139'>[139]</a></span>
the door was not really locked, it had been fastened
with strips of rawhide in such a manner as to show that
the owner wished to keep out stragglers.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-140.jpg" width="495" height="279" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
As we journeyed leisurely and comfortably down the
valley of the Sacramento, we saw now and then large
droves of wild horses and elks feeding peacefully on the
plains, and there was never a night when Eben Jordan,
or some other of the hunters, did not bring in an
abundance of game.
</p>

<h2>
THE MISSION OF SAN JOSÉ
</h2>

<p>
Then came that day when we arrived at the little
village which is called the Mission of San José, and
although everything about us was strange, we said to
ourselves that at last we had come to our new home, for
it was near that place our fathers intended to buy land.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140'>[140]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The village of San José must at one time have had
many hundred inhabitants; but when we arrived it
was little better than a ruin. The houses, built of sun-dried
bricks, were without roofs and crumbling slowly
away, all of which appeared the more pitiful because of
the well-kept church and the fortlike two-story house
where lived the priests. Both buildings were in such
good repair that they afforded a striking contrast to
the tumble-down dwellings which could be seen near
at hand.
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src="images/i-141.jpg" width="495" height="286" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
I would love to tell how father built for himself a
house on land which he bought from the priests of the
Mission, and how mother and I set about making a
home which should be somewhat the same in appearance
as the one we had left in Pike County, but it is not for
me to do so.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141'>[141]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
OUR HOME IN CALIFORNIA
</h2>

<p>
It may be that at some time when our home here
is fully made as we would have it, I can tell you how we
live, what odd Spanish dishes we have on the table, how
great a profusion of fruit is at our hand for the gathering,
and very many other things which to me are most
interesting.
</p>

<p>
I have learned to love this land even more than I
did Pike County, which at one time I believed the most
beautiful spot on earth, and although it pleases me now
and then, when settlers come over the long trail, to
hear the younger members of the company singing
"My name it is Joe Bowers," I have almost forgotten
that Missouri was once my home.
</p>

<p>
I have come to look upon myself as belonging to
this beautiful valley where Nature is so lavish with all
her gifts, and therefore, instead of calling myself a
Piker, as in the days gone by, I dearly love to write so
all may see, that I am now, and ever shall be as long
as the good God allows me to remain in this world,
Martha of California.
